This is a new format I'm trying out! I travel a lot for conventions and concerts, and while I sometimes try to write long and detailed event reports (even if I don't finish them half the time) I want to start posting smaller summaries too! Normally I'll try to post these around the end of the month as that's where I think they make the most sense, but this one is special!<p>The past week has been what I can only describe as a "live rush". 9 days, 5 concerts, 3 cities. Legitimately, it's been one of the best week's of my life. Crazy, hectic, insane, busy, and long, but worth every second.<p>I also want to note that exactly 2 years ago today was the start of Liella!'s 4th Live Tour ~Brand New Sparkle~! 2023.08.19 was the very first day of their tour, at Makuhari Messe in Chiba! This was Liella!'s first performance with 11 members present! Saku-chan made her LoveLive! debut with Liella! that day, and was absolutely stunning!<p>4th Live Chiba is also very special to me, because it marks the day where I first fell in love with Liella!! By chance and a lot of luck, I attended both days of 4th Live Chiba and the sights I saw those two days changed the course of my life forever in the best way possible. I would not be who I am today without Liella!.<h2 id=liella-first-generation-lovelive-wonderful-starlines-tokyo-performance>Liella!

I'm working on a full event report for both the Tokyo and Osaka stops of <em>Wonderful Starlines</em> that will be posted very soon. Once it is, I'll link it here, and it'll also be available in the blog list.<p>TL:DR: 10/10, no notes. <em>the best</em> live I've ever been to. Changed my life, and woke me up from and endless dream. It was everything I could've ever asked for, any regrets I had have been cured, and I wish I could live in those blissful moments forever. My heart floats like a feather without a care in the world after this.<p><img alt="First row view from my seat on Day 1" src=/img/event-summary-2025-08/wonderful-starlines.jpg> <img alt="First row view from my seat on Day 1, with my Kanon kuripan" src=/img/event-summary-2025-08/wonderful-starlines-kanon.jpg><h2 id=liella-special-lovelive-connect-the-stars>Liella!

Since canonically the second- and third-generation members created <em>Wonderful Starlines</em> for the original five to make up for their lives happening during the pandemic, <em>Connect the Stars</em> was their chance to not only sing <em>with</em> their senpais but show just how much they've grown themselves! We got subunit songs, Sunny Passion performed their songs and joined in with Liella!, the second- and third-gen members performed their own highlight reel stunning us all, I got to see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFe-qDN11wc" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Aspire</a> for the first time, and we got an announcement for Liella! 7th Live! All in all an amazing live, one for the history books. A solid 8.5/10.<p>If I have time, I might write a full event report for this one too once I have time to flesh out my notes and re-watch the live stream!<p><img alt="The logo for Connect the Stars inside the venue" src=/img/event-summary-2025-08/connect-the-stars-logo.jpg> <img alt="Outside of the venue" src=/img/event-summary-2025-08/connect-the-stars-ariake.jpg><h2 id=u-next-music-fes-lovelive-series-expo-2025-stage-right-now>U-Next Music Fes LoveLive!

Members from every group were present (three members of μ's, Aqours with their "subunit" YYY, four members of Nijigasaki, Liella! with their subunit CatChu!, Hasunosora, and Bluebird/Ikizurai-bu), and sang a few songs each! Aqours summoned a massive thunderstorm that struck the expo near the end of their set, delaying the performance for at least 15-20 minutes as the skies erupted into a torrential downpour. By the time it was CatChu!'s turn, the sky shifted to a beautiful sunset. We also got a collaboration version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIr3O9Di_hU" rel="nofollow noreferrer">AiScream</a> with a member from each group joining in! (it's the link)<p>It was an emotional rollercoaster because of the weather, but I was amazed seeing LL! on such a grand stage! They all brought their A-game and were keen to show everyone just what LoveLive! is made of! I jumped so hard for CatChu! I hurt my leg again while making the people around me giggle as I taught them what it means to cheer for CatChu! during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP1VSBZWDKA" rel="nofollow noreferrer">全力ライオット</a>.<p>I jumped so high for CatChu! that my subsequent jumps were late because I took too long to fall back to earth. An easy 8/10. Maybe even 8.5/10.<p><img alt="Banner showing all the LoveLive! groups performing" src=/img/event-summary-2025-08/unext-banner.jpg> <img alt="Nighttime view of the stage" src=/img/event-summary-2025-08/unext-stage.jpg><h2 id=ikiduraibu-1st-single-what-is-my-life-free-live-event>いきづらい部！ 1st Single「What is my LIFE?」 Free Live & Event<a aria-label="Anchor link for: ikiduraibu-1st-single-what-is-my-life-free-live-event" class=zola-anchor href=#ikiduraibu-1st-single-what-is-my-life-free-live-event style=visibility:hidden>#</a></h2><p>Date: 2025.08.15<br> Venue: Abeno Q's Mall Outdoor Stage, Osaka<br> <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.eventernote.com/events/433880>EventerNote</a><p>It was crazy hot out, but I managed to find a spot to watch after arriving only an hour before show start by squeezing in with some friends. I didn't have a great view, but I had a view. Can we stop doing lives outside in the middle of summer in a concrete box? Thanks.<p>Fun, but I had a far better time (and view) watching the same songs performed at the expo the day before. Would go again though. 5/10.<p>Akira's seiyuu is super cute.<h2 id=inami-anju-live-tour-2025-yummy-yummy-feast>Inami Anju Live Tour 2025 「Yummy! Yummy!

A super small venue, no more than 400 seats (probably less). Her first time performing in Sendai, and she sold out the venue! Because it was so intimate, she made sure to smile and make eye contact with everyone at least once, and give out lots of waves and hearts to everyone!<p>Where do I even begin? She is so incredibly talented. She can, and does, sing every genre of music from rap to reggae to ballads and rock songs. She does it all flawlessly, and looks absolutely gorgeous doing it to boot.<p>Spoilers for those of you going later in the tour, SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH. I couldn't be happier seeing her perform Ready Fighter! I think it's my new favorite song of hers. During the NPNL "Painful Remix", she grabbed a golden megaphone and rapped through it into the microphone. I damn near fell to the floor at that sight. She couldn't be cooler if she was in Antartica. She also sang LOVE DON!!! for the first time this tour, and made sure we sang a lot together with her which made her incredibly happy!<p>Everything a live with Anchan should be. Fun, powerful, emotional, packed with energy, and full of the biggest smiles anyone could muster. At least a 9/10. I wish I could go to the Tokyo sessions.<p>Also, I ran into the venue less than 5 minutes before the live started, and stopped at the CD sales table to buy a single CD since they still had the live-venue exclusive bonus. I won the lottery for a signed, personalized shikishi! It's my second signed item from her for Fiesta, and I couldn't feel luckier!<p><img alt="My Anchan itabag, with two hand-signed releases of Fiesta" src=/img/event-summary-2025-08/anchan-sign.jpg><h2 id=aya-emori-2nd-ep-always-with-you-release-event-vol-2>Aya Emori 2nd EP『Always with you』 Release Event vol.2<a aria-label="Anchor link for: aya-emori-2nd-ep-always-with-you-release-event-vol-2" class=zola-anchor href=#aya-emori-2nd-ep-always-with-you-release-event-vol-2 style=visibility:hidden>#</a></h2><p>Date: 2025.08.19<br> Venue: KAMEIDO CLOCK Mall Stage, Tokyo<br> <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.eventernote.com/events/439341>EventerNote</a><p><img alt="Stage for Emori Aya's Free Live" src=/img/event-summary-2025-08/emorin-handover.jpg><p>I nearly arrived too late to buy a CD for a priority viewing area ticket + 1:1 meeting ticket, but managed to make it on time. I had to buy tickets for several people running even later than me, so even though I pulled the 5th entry ticket (you enter the area by number, I got 5th), I had to wait around for them to arrive. I still had a great view, there were probably 50 people in the priority area overall.<p>Emorin came out and did a sound check to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2bjX0ptSI8" rel="nofollow noreferrer">フラフィナナ</a> which was super cute! She also had us practice our clapping to the off-vocal of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94j9yovgMjc" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Eureka!</a>. She sang Eureka! for the mini live itself, which was such a cute and fun song! Emorin really does have an infectious smile, I couldn't take my eyes off her and she sang and clapped and laughed with everyone on stage.<p>Afterwards, I participated in the 1:1 talk session with Emorin! Since I only bought a single CD I was only able to talk to her for 5 seconds, but that was more than enough. I was introduced by a friend and huge fan of Emorin's, and she looked so happy that I had come from California to see her! I thanked her for today, and told her it was a lot of fun. She thanked me repeatedly, having a lot of fun saying my name (lol). She's so dang cute.<p>Thankfully, this venue was air conditioned! I'm looking at you, Ikizurai-bu. After everyone had finished she thanked everyone for coming and glanced at the Starbucks opposite the stage, remaking how much she wanted some. Obviously, we went to Starbucks after. 7.5/10 at least.<p><img alt="Starbucks after the live" src=/img/event-summary-2025-08/emorin-starbucks.jpg><h1 id=end>End<a aria-label="Anchor link for: end" class=zola-anchor href=#end style=visibility:hidden>#</a></h1><p>I don't want this live rush to end. I will make sure I never lose these amazing feelings.<p>As for the format, I'm not sure I'm going to keep the scores around going forward unless something really warrants it (like Wonderful Starlines.) I don't think it's fair to rate events of drastically different calibers like that, it's just something I came up with while writing. We'll see!</article></div><footer><div class=copyright><p>© 2023 mikansoro</div><div class=credits>powered by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=https://www.getzola.org target=_blank>zola</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=https://github.com/isunjn/serene target=_blank>serene</a></div></footer></main></div><script src=/js/lightense.min.js></script><script src=/js/main.js></script>
