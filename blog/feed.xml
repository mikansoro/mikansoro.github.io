		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi! This is a new format I&#x27;m trying out! I travel a lot for conventions and concerts, and while I sometimes try to write long and detailed event reports (even if I don&#x27;t finish them half the time) I want to start posting smaller summaries too! Normally I&#x27;ll try to post these around the end of the month as that&#x27;s where I think they make the most sense, but this one is special! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past week has been what I can only describe as a &amp;quot;live rush&amp;quot;. 9 days, 5 concerts, 3 cities. Legitimately, it&#x27;s been one of the best week&#x27;s of my life. Crazy, hectic, insane, busy, and long, but worth every second. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to note that exactly 2 years ago today was the start of Liella!&#x27;s 4th Live Tour ~Brand New Sparkle~! 2023.08.19 was the very first day of their tour, at Makuhari Messe in Chiba! This was Liella!&#x27;s first performance with 11 members present! Saku-chan made her LoveLive! debut with Liella! that day, and was absolutely stunning! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4th Live Chiba is also very special to me, because it marks the day where I first fell in love with Liella!! By chance and a lot of luck, I attended both days of 4th Live Chiba and the sights I saw those two days changed the course of my life forever in the best way possible. I would not be who I am today without Liella!. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

EventerNote &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eventernote.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;426450&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eventernote.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;426451&quot;&gt;Day 2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in the audience both days for the Tokyo stop of &lt;em&gt;Wonderful Starlines&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. I&#x27;m working on a full event report for both the Tokyo and Osaka stops of &lt;em&gt;Wonderful Starlines&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; that will be posted very soon. Once it is, I&#x27;ll link it here, and it&#x27;ll also be available in the blog list. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL:DR: 10&#x2F;10, no notes. &lt;em&gt;the best&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; live I&#x27;ve ever been to. Changed my life, and woke me up from and endless dream. It was everything I could&#x27;ve ever asked for, any regrets I had have been cured, and I wish I could live in those blissful moments forever. My heart floats like a feather without a care in the world after this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An 11-member Special Live where all of Liella! could reunite after &lt;em&gt;Wonderful Starlines&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;! Since canonically the second- and third-generation members created &lt;em&gt;Wonderful Starlines&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for the original five to make up for their lives happening during the pandemic, &lt;em&gt;Connect the Stars&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was their chance to not only sing &lt;em&gt;with&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; their senpais but show just how much they&#x27;ve grown themselves! We got subunit songs, Sunny Passion performed their songs and joined in with Liella!, the second- and third-gen members performed their own highlight reel stunning us all, I got to see &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=eFe-qDN11wc&quot;&gt;Aspire&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for the first time, and we got an announcement for Liella! 7th Live! All in all an amazing live, one for the history books. A solid 8.5&#x2F;10. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I have time, I might write a full event report for this one too once I have time to flesh out my notes and re-watch the live stream! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Date: 2025.08.14&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Venue: EXPO ARENA Matsuri, Osaka World Expo&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ll-fans.jp&#x2F;data&#x2F;event&#x2F;252&quot;&gt;Setlist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eventernote.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;425156&quot;&gt;EventerNote&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LoveLive! had its own dedicated concert at the Osaka World Expo! Members from every group were present (three members of μ&#x27;s, Aqours with their &amp;quot;subunit&amp;quot; YYY, four members of Nijigasaki, Liella! with their subunit CatChu!, Hasunosora, and Bluebird&#x2F;Ikizurai-bu), and sang a few songs each! Aqours summoned a massive thunderstorm that struck the expo near the end of their set, delaying the performance for at least 15-20 minutes as the skies erupted into a torrential downpour. By the time it was CatChu!&#x27;s turn, the sky shifted to a beautiful sunset. We also got a collaboration version of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QIr3O9Di_hU&quot;&gt;AiScream&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with a member from each group joining in! (it&#x27;s the link)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an emotional rollercoaster because of the weather, but I was amazed seeing LL! on such a grand stage! They all brought their A-game and were keen to show everyone just what LoveLive! is made of! I jumped so hard for CatChu! I hurt my leg again while making the people around me giggle as I taught them what it means to cheer for CatChu! during &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nP1VSBZWDKA&quot;&gt;全力ライオット&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I jumped so high for CatChu! that my subsequent jumps were late because I took too long to fall back to earth. An easy 8&#x2F;10. Maybe even 8.5&#x2F;10. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was crazy hot out, but I managed to find a spot to watch after arriving only an hour before show start by squeezing in with some friends. I didn&#x27;t have a great view, but I had a view. Can we stop doing lives outside in the middle of summer in a concrete box? Thanks. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun, but I had a far better time (and view) watching the same songs performed at the expo the day before. Would go again though. 5&#x2F;10. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akira&#x27;s seiyuu is super cute. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Date: 2025.08.17&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Venue: Sendai Rensa&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eventernote.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;422784&quot;&gt;EventerNote&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;event-summary-2025-08&#x2F;anchan-live.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Venue sign showing Anchan&#x27;s live&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anchan released her first full album &lt;em&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ktMNwd4KBFvAwi8nAwvPxAMPJjHX29qAg&quot;&gt;Fiesta&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and this was the second stop on her summer live tour celebrating the album&#x27;s release! A super small venue, no more than 400 seats (probably less). Her first time performing in Sendai, and she sold out the venue! Because it was so intimate, she made sure to smile and make eye contact with everyone at least once, and give out lots of waves and hearts to everyone! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do I even begin? She is so incredibly talented. She can, and does, sing every genre of music from rap to reggae to ballads and rock songs. She does it all flawlessly, and looks absolutely gorgeous doing it to boot. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoilers for those of you going later in the tour, SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH. I couldn&#x27;t be happier seeing her perform Ready Fighter! I think it&#x27;s my new favorite song of hers. During the NPNL &amp;quot;Painful Remix&amp;quot;, she grabbed a golden megaphone and rapped through it into the microphone. I damn near fell to the floor at that sight. She couldn&#x27;t be cooler if she was in Antartica. She also sang LOVE DON!!! for the first time this tour, and made sure we sang a lot together with her which made her incredibly happy!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything a live with Anchan should be. Fun, powerful, emotional, packed with energy, and full of the biggest smiles anyone could muster. At least a 9&#x2F;10. I wish I could go to the Tokyo sessions. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I ran into the venue less than 5 minutes before the live started, and stopped at the CD sales table to buy a single CD since they still had the live-venue exclusive bonus. I won the lottery for a signed, personalized shikishi! It&#x27;s my second signed item from her for Fiesta, and I couldn&#x27;t feel luckier! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Date: 2025.08.19&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Venue: KAMEIDO CLOCK Mall Stage, Tokyo&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eventernote.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;439341&quot;&gt;EventerNote&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;event-summary-2025-08&#x2F;emorin-handover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stage for Emori Aya&#x27;s Free Live&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nearly arrived too late to buy a CD for a priority viewing area ticket + 1:1 meeting ticket, but managed to make it on time. I had to buy tickets for several people running even later than me, so even though I pulled the 5th entry ticket (you enter the area by number, I got 5th), I had to wait around for them to arrive. I still had a great view, there were probably 50 people in the priority area overall. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emorin came out and did a sound check to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=k2bjX0ptSI8&quot;&gt;フラフィナナ&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which was super cute! She also had us practice our clapping to the off-vocal of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=94j9yovgMjc&quot;&gt;Eureka!&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. She sang Eureka! for the mini live itself, which was such a cute and fun song! Emorin really does have an infectious smile, I couldn&#x27;t take my eyes off her and she sang and clapped and laughed with everyone on stage. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, I participated in the 1:1 talk session with Emorin! Since I only bought a single CD I was only able to talk to her for 5 seconds, but that was more than enough. I was introduced by a friend and huge fan of Emorin&#x27;s, and she looked so happy that I had come from California to see her! I thanked her for today, and told her it was a lot of fun. She thanked me repeatedly, having a lot of fun saying my name (lol). She&#x27;s so dang cute. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, this venue was air conditioned! I&#x27;m looking at you, Ikizurai-bu. After everyone had finished she thanked everyone for coming and glanced at the Starbucks opposite the stage, remaking how much she wanted some. Obviously, we went to Starbucks after. 7.5&#x2F;10 at least. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;event-summary-2025-08&#x2F;emorin-starbucks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Starbucks after the live&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t want this live rush to end. I will make sure I never lose these amazing feelings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the format, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to keep the scores around going forward unless something really warrants it (like Wonderful Starlines.) I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to rate events of drastically different calibers like that, it&#x27;s just something I came up with while writing. We&#x27;ll see! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve been really slow to update this blog. Sorry about that. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&#x27;t forgotten. I&#x27;m not actually sure anyone reads anything posted here, but if there is anyone, more content is coming.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year I feel like my writing has gone down in both speed &lt;em&gt;and&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; quality, which is making it difficult to find the motivation to actually complete posts and release them in a state fit for outside consumption. I have so much that I want to say though, so I&#x27;m going to keep working on improving and posting with more frequency. (and be less lazy.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve been traveling a lot this year, and those travels have led to some truly incredible moments. I want to share them with you, if I can figure out how to do the stories justice with words. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the tech crowd I&#x27;ve been working out the jank in my homelab, so I have adventures to share there too. I don&#x27;t want to just rant at the sky, so I need time to find solutions to my problems before I post them (hopefully). I might end up yelling at clouds anyway though. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for making it this far. I can&#x27;t promise anything other than continuing to work hard to distill and capture interesting stories and share them with you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still want to update this site&#x27;s theme too, and eventually add multilingual support (in some limited capacity) for Japanese. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <summary>&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, I promised myself that before Aqours&#x27; final (or Finale) live, I would travel to each venue that I&#x27;d seen then perform in over the years one more time as a &amp;quot;pilgrimage&amp;quot; of sorts. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I went, I wrote down my emotions and reactions. These aren&#x27;t really &amp;quot;edited&amp;quot; in any meaningful way before posting. Either they don&#x27;t make sense, or they ramble on and on. But they&#x27;re my experineces as I felt them. I think its good to be honest about our feelings sometimes, so I&#x27;d like to share a few of mine. I doubt there will be any grand conclusion to this. Maybe an event report from Finale, if I can find a gap in the tears to write it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m sitting on the train out to MetLife&#x2F;belluna dome now. I didn&#x27;t plan on today being the start of my pilgrimage, but that&#x27;s how it turned out. I decided to start with Belluna Dome since it&#x27;s probably the least accessible late at night, but it also hits a little harder since exactly 54 days from now I&#x27;ll be sitting on the train to finale. I&#x27;m listening to the sunshine ost as I write this, and I&#x27;m trying my best not to cry (as much as id like to). &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s eerie out here and I don&#x27;t like it. The only other time I&#x27;ve been out here, it was packed full of fans coming to support Aqours. Listening to the main theme, I could almost see the Finale stage through a gap in the dome wall, with the nine members of Aqours standing on it. Past that, a full dome packed with 35000 people, ready to shout themselves hoarse attempting to convey even a fraction of their love for the angels of Aqours. It just, doesn&#x27;t feel right out here. I&#x27;m not ready for June. Even being out here, it hasn&#x27;t sank in. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing about this feels right. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t want Aqours to end. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving at the station, my heart felt tight and panicked. The station is exactly as I remember it, though I mainly remember it at night. Even though some things have changed in the surrounding area and I don&#x27;t have many photos of what the area around the dome looked like in 2019, I can see all the fans walking back and forth as I walk up the road. I can hear the excited clamor of everyone looking forward to the live. Walking back to the station, I can feel the crowd crush of fans attempting to get on a train back to Tokyo.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MetLife Dome (as it was known back then) was the last place I saw Aqours in a nine-man solo live. That was almost 6 years ago now. The next (and last) time I can say that will be Finale, right back here in this spot. Their second home.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently as of 5&#x2F;1, Musashino Forest Sports Plaza officially becomes Keio Arena Tokyo. The signs are already up. To me though, this will always be Musashino Forest Sports Plaza (or Musapura for short, as Liella!&#x27;s Suzuhara Nozomi would call it a few months after I saw Yohane and her friends perform here). &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most recent venues I&#x27;ve seen Aqours perform at, so it was full of happy memories. &amp;quot;Recent&amp;quot; as in, 18 months ago. Listening to 「La la 勇気のうた」 filled me with a bit of courage and instantly transported me back to December 2023. During that song the stage lights repeatedly flashed blue, pink, and yellow; they perfectly highlighted the costumes of all nine of them on stage singing their song of courage. Midway through the song a flurry of streamers burst through the air, leading me to hope that maybe one of my friends in the arena could catch one for me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it wasn&#x27;t an &amp;quot;Aqours&amp;quot; solo live, I was so happy to see them on stage again that I didn&#x27;t care that my seats weren&#x27;t great. I was just happy to see them again and to get excited about the next time I&#x27;d be able to see them perform. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Liella! is the first group that comes to my mind when I think of K Arena, I&#x27;ve been luckily enough to see most of the members of Aqours perform there too. My first time seeing CYaRon! again since their 1st live (4 years prior) was here. CYaRon! brought back references from their first live, and even broke out into playing baseball mid song. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t feel uneasy at the thought of being at K Arena for a trip like this. Maybe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve already gotten over some of the fears of Aqours being gone, or maybe because it&#x27;s the venue I&#x27;ve seen them at that I have the weakest connection to. Either way, I can only think of happy memories of Aqours and their subunits here, which is exactly what they&#x27;d want to be remembered for. At this point, I can feel my heart sparkling again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight couldn&#x27;t have been any more different than my first day seeing Tokyo Dome, which was a sunny, cloudless morning full of hope and optimism 6.5 years ago. I walked up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as nobori of Aqours members fluttered in the breeze to Tokyo Dome, my first ever live venue in Japan. It was Aqours&#x27; first time there too, performing a solo live at Tokyo Dome after just three short years of performances. Not only did they make it to Tokyo Dome, but they sold it out at 55,000 people per day (with 250,000 more in movie theaters across the world to watch a live feed). I told myself I would do whatever was necessary to see Aqours perform on that stage and by god I did so. Aqours 4th live was, without a doubt, two of the best nights of my life. If I had told myself 2 years prior to going (in 2016, with the wound from µ&#x27;s Final Live still fresh) that I would be there to see Aqours perform in Tokyo Dome, I would&#x27;ve loathed you for even getting my hopes up. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this day, it remains my sharpest memories of any live I&#x27;ve been to. If I close my eyes, I&#x27;ll be standing back in my seat in the second row of stands, just behind the dugout. I&#x27;ll be watching Rikyako descend the stairs to the main stage as the piano chorus to OmoHito tugs on each of my heartstrings. I&#x27;ll be staring in awe as a sailing ship carries Aqours effortlessly across a sea of sparkling lights to the wonderful tune of Mirai Ticket. To say it means a lot to me would be a gross understatement. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Day 2 of Aqours&#x27; 4th Live, I made myself a promise that I would never miss a) another Aqours performance in Tokyo Dome and b) an Aqours numbered live. No matter what happened, I would be there. Regardless of my determination, I was forced to break that promise thanks to the pandemic border closures. That still weighs on me, and even now I remember what could&#x27;ve been. I did make it back to see them on that stage again during the Ijigen Fes, a legendary cross-franchise collaboration event between The Idolmaster and Love Live that will go down in history as one of the most incredible nights of performing the world will ever see. I can&#x27;t believe that was already almost 18 months ago. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast those feelings to tonight; a cold, rainy april and a compounding sense of dread that Aqours&#x27; days of performing as a full group of nine are drawing to a close. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Chuo-Sobu Local train between Ochanomizu and Suidobashi, it took everything I had not to cry to Kiseki Hikaru. As I approached the dome, I closed my eyes to see all of the nobori from Aqours 4th Live and Ijigen Fes lining the walkway, the corridors draped in Aqours&#x27; members&#x27; bright sparkling smiles. Under a small outcropping, I quietly sang Thank You, Friends! to myself, my eyes closed so I could exist in the venue once more. I sobbed as the Main Theme and KimiKoko played through my headphones, reliving the start of the live as if it was happening again for the first time. I continued listening to the setlist as I left, tears flowing from a swirling vortex of happiness and sadness within my heart. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like they carved their names into love live history, they certainly carved their names in mine. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In episode 12 of Season 2, Aqours runs up the stairs to a footbridge down the street from Tokyo Dome right before their performance of Water Blue New World. In 2018 on our way to Tokyo Dome for 4th Live, my newly-found friends and I took a picture on that bridge with the dome in the background. Over the four days I spent in Japan in 2018, all of us went from knowing nothing about each other to becoming a nearly unbreakably-tight knit group of friends. We&#x27;d talk all hours of the day and night, and see each other in Japan every few months to support Aqours with everything we had. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&#x27;ve lost all but basic contact with almost all of them, for one reason or another. None of them regret their time spent following Aqours, but all of them have left.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking up onto that bridge tonight hurt more than visiting any other spot could.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish we could all see Aqours perform again together some day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was here as my last venue before lockdowns began, and I&#x27;ve already returned for another live (liella 5L). &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a sunny spring morning, a couple clouds in the sky. A gentle sea breeze. The sunshine is warm, but comforting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My memories of Liella 5L are obviously fresher, and when I came back last January for that I had a bit of an emotional moment seeing the Kokura station sign again. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to &lt;em&gt;Changeless&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is making me emotional. I remember standing on the shinkansen (there were no seats so I was standing between cars) on the way back to Fukuoka the monday after cyr 1st with tears running down my cheek. I didn&#x27;t want that weekend to end. I still don&#x27;t, in a way. I don&#x27;t want to leave, even now. I think a part of me is still in that hall in 2020, &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve rewatched CYR 1L after 2020.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ラブライブ！サンシャイン!! Aqours 2nd LoveLive! HAPPY PARTY TRAIN TOUR Delayed Viewing&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
2017.10.14&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delayed viewing for Aqours 2nd Live Tour was my first DV. I didn&#x27;t even know if I&#x27;d make it. I red-eye&#x27;d overnight from Texas to LA on a shoestring budget, but there was no way I&#x27;d miss any opportunity to see Aqours again. I was still reeling from the excitement of seeing Aqours in person for the first time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That DV made me realize (again) that my love for Aqours was absolute. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a whole story about how I was barely able to buy goods at the theater that day, though that&#x27;s one I only tell in person. If you know me that well, you can ask me about it. Long story short, I bought the last penlight out from under someone that I&#x27;d later become best friends with, even though when we met again we had no idea that had happened that day. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I meet Aqours is a treasured memory. Even though there&#x27;s clouds today, I can feel the sun shining down on me like it always did when I was there with Aqours.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOVE LIVE! SUNSHINE!! Aqours World LoveLive! in LA ～BRAND NEW WAVE～&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
2019.07.05-2019.07.06&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;aqours-venue-pilgrimage&#x2F;16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Novo - Brand New Wave Tickets&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from being in my (now) home city, The NOVO holds a special place in my heart because it&#x27;s the last place I saw Aqours perform as a full (well, kind of) group before the pandemic hit. I&#x27;ve been back inside once since 2019, but all my memories of this venue are filled only with Aqours. 2019 felt like yesterday as I ascended the escalator to the third floor entrance. It&#x27;s so close to home, but that time is so far away now. Except for in my heart, I think. If you told me back then it&#x27;d be almost 6 years until the next time I&#x27;d be at an Aqours solo event, I would&#x27;ve laughed in your face. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 1 of BRAND NEW WAVE was my first time getting a VIP ticket to an Aqours LA live, which meant I could finally participate in their Omikurikai (a post-event goodbye session where you walk past and wave). It was the first time I&#x27;d met any seiyuu, and it&#x27;d be my idols. During &lt;em&gt;Hop? Stop? Nonstop!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; I held my penlights in the shape of an &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; (in the color orange, for Chika), and as Anchan twirled gracefully on stage, she saw me up in the first row of the balcony. She made an &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; back to me with her hands and gave me a big smile. I couldn&#x27;t believe it, she&#x27;d seen it! As I waved to each member after the live, Anchan saw me again, and with the same bright smile she thanked me. To say I was happy would be the understatement of the century. In a few brief seconds, my oshi made me the happiest I could&#x27;ve possibly been. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping with Aqours&#x27; tradition of terrible weather following them everywhere they go, there was an earthquake during &lt;em&gt;Brightest Melody&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. I remember my legs feeling exhausted during the song, and like the whole balcony was swaying. I was so focused on Aqours, I didnt find out it was an earthquake until after they rushed off stage for safety. I just thought we were jumping hard enough to make the balcony shake, and that a costume change after one song was a little strange. Luckily no one was hurt, and the live resumed without incident. A memory for sure. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I walked, I could feel the heat from the sun that day, I could feel the tension in the crowd, I could hear the excited murmors of everyone standing in line to go see Aqours again that weekend. I felt my own excitement from that time, getting to see Aqours perform twice in one month!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish we could&#x27;ve made it 5 years in a row. We all promised we&#x27;d try.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss those peaceful, youthful days. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the last stop on my trip. Not only is it the closest venue to home where I cheered for Aqours, it&#x27;s the one that hits closest to home emotionally. The Microsoft Theater was the first place I saw Aqours perform live. It was the place I saw their first overseas solo live. It&#x27;s a place where my dreams of seeing a Love Live concert in person finally came true.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the announcement that Aqours would be performing at Anime Expo 2017 was made, my girlfriend and I spent hours on the phone as we planned out how, no matter what, we&#x27;d be in that audience. Needless to say, we made it. Missing this chance wasn&#x27;t an option. I spent weeks preparing, learning calls and watching the anime and Aqours 1st Live over and over again. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They finally took the stage. I cheered, I cried, and I knew in my heart that I would follow Aqours until the end. In 2017 I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to go to Japan to see them, but that distant dream grew stronger and stronger. I wanted to reach out and chase my dreams, just like Aqours had done.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;d be back again for Aqours first one-man overseas live just one year later. In 2017, I couldn&#x27;t have dreamt that they&#x27;d be back for a full solo live. I spent all morning in line for goods, on the hottest day of the summer. It was worth it though! With just enough time to cool off, my girlfriend and I headed back into the Microsoft Theater once more, where we were kindly offered seats near the front by two kindhearted fans that wanted to sit near their friends. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have too many feelings and memories from that night, but not enough words to put them in. One moment, naturally, stood above the rest. During 「勇気はどこに？君の胸に！」, we managed to surprise Aqours with a rainbow of lights. As Anchan sang her solo, wave after wave of color rose in unison in a spectacular display of love and affection for Aqours. Anchan&#x27;s voice broke, and everyone in the room, Aqours and us, cried through the rest of the song. I&#x27;m not sure anything could ever top that moment. The rainbow was a sight burned so completely into my memories that even if I lost every memory I&#x27;ve ever made, it&#x27;d still be there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sad about not making it to 3rd live. But after that night, I was going to make it to 4th no matter what. It was the push I needed to make even more of my dreams come true. To reach out my hand and chase that shining light. Their shining light. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for inspiring me, and helping me to chase my dreams. I&#x27;ve gotten lost a lot along the way, but because of Aqours&#x27; support I&#x27;ll always get back up again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqours is eternal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusion&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there such a thing as a conclusion for a legacy like theirs?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon it&#x27;ll be time for Aqours to stand on their Eternal Stage. A grand sendoff for the past 10 years of wonderful stories. A celebration of the incredible feats they&#x27;ve achieved, of the heights they flew chasing their radiance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know they&#x27;re not going away. But to me, this is the end of an era. Aqours has been with me my entire adult life. I don&#x27;t know what shape my life would&#x27;ve taken without them. But I know I wouldn&#x27;t be 1&#x2F;10th of the person I am today without them. I&#x27;ll keep my love of Aqours alive in my heart, so let&#x27;s walk hand in hand towards the future. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Aqours will be performing at Belluna Dome on June 21st and 22nd for their Finale LoveLive!. This will be their last performance as a group of nine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really didn&#x27;t want to have to write this, but in the wake of the venue announcement some people have been expressing their disappointment for Aqours&#x27; Finale not taking place in Tokyo Dome in ways that are simply unacceptable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must state this in the most unambiguous terms:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;it-is-not-okay-to-attack-insult-or-blame-other-lovelive-groups-seiyuu-or-staff-over-aqours-finale-live-s-venue&quot;&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; okay to attack, insult, or blame other LoveLive! groups, seiyuu, or staff over Aqours&#x27; Finale Live&#x27;s venue.&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#it-is-not-okay-to-attack-insult-or-blame-other-lovelive-groups-seiyuu-or-staff-over-aqours-finale-live-s-venue&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: it-is-not-okay-to-attack-insult-or-blame-other-lovelive-groups-seiyuu-or-staff-over-aqours-finale-live-s-venue&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who does this is not a fan of Aqours.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please hear me when I say this. If you invoke hate in Aqours&#x27; name, you are no fan of theirs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love Live staff is not trying to kick Aqours out the door to &amp;quot;make room&amp;quot; for other groups, nor are the other groups forcing them out. Staff is not being greedy by placing them in a smaller dome to increase CD sales from those afraid they will not get a ticket. And no, it&#x27;s not possible to move an NPB baseball game just for some idol concert to happen on a particular day. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From their very first day, Aqours has sought to inspire us, to remind us that our dreams can come true, and that it&#x27;s always worth searching for the light that exists within us. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- 
To update: 

- talk about why dome tour isnt feasible anymore (its not 2019)
- discuss why it&#x27;s not possible to get tokyo dome around the finale dates (aka, baseball exists)
- start with some more personal exposition (the &quot;ive been following them forever&quot; stuff)
- compoind on the above message
--&gt;
&lt;!--
No, it&#x27;s not Liella!&#x27;s fault, or Niji&#x27;s fault, or Hasu&#x27;s fault, or Staff wanting to push them out the door. 
No, it&#x27;s not greed. 
No, they can&#x27;t move baseball games just for Aqours.

Do not put words in the seiyuu&#x27;s mouths. Do not attack anyone over this decision.

If you attack other groups over this, you are exactly the kind of fan Aqours had to face. 

Don&#x27;t you dare invoke hate in their name.
--&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-zero-to-one-and-from-one-to-something-beyond&quot;&gt;From Zero to One, and from One to Something Beyond...&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#from-zero-to-one-and-from-one-to-something-beyond&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: from-zero-to-one-and-from-one-to-something-beyond&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nine members of Aqours have worked tirelessly for the last nine years, against doubt and by exceeding all expectations, to prove that they were as worthy of bearing the torch of the LoveLive! franchise. Their success was never guaranteed. At the time of µ&#x27;s Final LoveLive! in 2016, a large portion of fans of this franchise accused LoveLive! Staff of killing µ&#x27;s to promote Aqours and deemed Aqours unworthy as a group before they really had a chance to start. Their struggle wasn&#x27;t just to prove themselves in an industry surrounded by competition outside of LoveLive!, but to prove to fans of a franchise &lt;em&gt;they themselves loved&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; that they deserved to be there. They started from zero, and turned that zero into a one. They turned that one into two, two into ten, and ten into one hundred. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the hate they received, and the hardships they faced, the nine members of Aqours were determined to carry LoveLive! forward. They brought the franchise to new heights and created a space where new groups could flourish and coexist alongside them, filled with their beloved kouhai who were all once fans themselves. Some of whom were fans from an open audition, with no past experience or agency connections. Aqours created an environment for them to thrive together, to create amazing music, stunning performances, and weave wonderful stories together. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 31st, 2020, Aqours had a live stream consisting of Anchan, Arisha and Rikako in which they discussed the 2020 LoveLive! Fes among other topics. One of the letters was from a fan of µ&#x27;s, who said at the time of Aqours&#x27; inception they were unable to listen to their music or give Aqours a chance. But after watching Fes they realized they were wrong all those years. They saw the love and care Aqours held for LoveLive! and realized that no, they weren&#x27;t stealing their group away or ruining the franchise. This fan promised to support Aqours from then on, even if they were arriving a little late. Rikako started to cry; she said those were the words that every one of them had been wishing to hear for five years. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Aqours has always been about overcoming hardships, connecting people together, and searching for the shining light that exists within all of us. Do not lose sight of that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-end-of-an-era&quot;&gt;The End of an Era&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-end-of-an-era&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-end-of-an-era&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see Aqours perform in Tokyo Dome more than anyone else. I&#x27;ve been following Aqours since their inception. I was fortunate enough to attend Aqours 4th Live in Tokyo Dome back in 2018. I know how much it means to see them perform on that stage. I know how much it matters to Aqours to perform on that stage. In that moment, I swore to myself then and there that I would never miss another Aqours live in Tokyo Dome. The pandemic made me break that promise. I thought I had one more shot with Finale. Turns out, it wasn&#x27;t meant to be.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust me, I&#x27;m sad too. I hoped that when the time came for Aqours sail into the sunshine, it would be on their highest note. With their 6L Dome Tour no longer a real possibility, I hoped we could create the greatest two-day live at Tokyo Dome to send them out with a bang.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqours always talked about trying to make it to ten years, an incredible feat for a seiyuu idol group. While activities have slowed drastically since the pandemic, they&#x27;re going to accomplish their goal. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&#x27;t be right to postpone the live past June just to pick a particular venue, or to hold it early and rob Aqours of acheiving their goal. Aqours has decided that this is their time to say goodbye (in a sense), to end this era and pass the LoveLive! torch on completely to their incredibly talented and beloved kouhais in Nijigasaki, Liella!, and Hasunosora. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;coming-home&quot;&gt;Coming Home&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#coming-home&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: coming-home&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s no venue more fitting of achieving that goal in than Belluna Dome. Aqours considers it to be their second home. Just as Numazu is and will always will be their home, Belluna Dome is their home. So for their swan-song to take place there, with thirty-thousand of their closest fans cheering their hearts out for their beloved Aqours, a venue that has hosted four of their previous six numbered lives is a fitting location to conclude their story. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not defend Belluna Dome as a venue. It&#x27;s an objectively bad venue for acoustics and lighting, and it&#x27;s inconvenient to get to. But it&#x27;s filled with memories Aqours and their fans made together over the last decade. It&#x27;s full of stories, smiles, and tears. It&#x27;s full of breathtaking performances and melodies that make the heart soar. We&#x27;ll be there to celebrate Aqours as their no.10, as they perform on their Eternal Stage. And there&#x27;s no place I&#x27;d rather be. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Sayuri Date Has Released Her First Original Songs!</title>
		<published>2024-09-10T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2024-09-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <summary>&lt;p&gt;Sayuri Date has released her first original songs today as part of the run up to her birthday event on September 30th! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
</summary>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sayuri Date has released her first original songs today as part of the run up to her birthday event on September 30th! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She dropped a surprise announcement at 9:00pm JST on Sept. 7th with the information for the new songs, and that the songs would be available on streaming sites at midnight local time on September 10th! They will also be performed live at the event on her birthday (September 30th)!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The songs are titled 「1up!」 and 「ラブソング」 (love song)! They&#x27;re both beautiful songs, upbeat and full of emotion, with lyrics filled with meaning!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both songs are available now, please go listen to them on your favorite streaming service! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lnk.to&#x2F;SayuriDate_BirthdayParty_22ndTW&quot;&gt;Link to all streaming platforms&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very momentous occasion for Sayurin. As she&#x27;s mentioned in past talk and mc segments, she&#x27;s struggled with confidence in her singing ability and essentially had to re-learn how to sing from scratch in order to sing professionally. She joined &lt;em&gt;LoveLive!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; through a fan audition and wasn&#x27;t trained or educated on singing professionally before that, causing her to grapple with a healthy case of imposter syndrome and comparing her singing to others. She truly loves singing, but during Liella!&#x27;s 3rd live tour she mentioned that she couldn&#x27;t bring herself to say that singing was her specialty.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, she&#x27;s reached a level of confidence that enabled her to truly enjoy singing on stage. At the end of Liella!&#x27;s 4th live tour in August 2023, she mentioned that 4L was the first time she was able to stand on stage and simply have fun singing and performing. At her birthday event on September 30th, 2023 she remarked that she was surprised so many people came to see her sing as herself, and not as a part of &lt;em&gt;LoveLive!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. In the year since she&#x27;s continued to grow in both singing ability and confidence, shining brightly on stage every time she&#x27;s in front of her fans.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sayurin mentioned on Instagram that she is still embarrassed when it comes to her singing, but was really happy hearing everyone&#x27;s warm comments about her new songs! Please make sure to go listen to both songs! If you want to help cheer her on and support her original music, make sure to tweet your impressions via the hashtag &lt;code&gt;#伊達さゆりBDパーティー&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; on twitter!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few of Sayurin&#x27;s tweets about the announcement and songs (where she&#x27;s very excited!): &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hacky one-liner for bulk renaming hosts. Enjoy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently when deploying multiple VMs via xen-orchestra, cloud-init will not respect the per-vm name field in the advanced options menu. Instead of recreating them one-by-one, I bulk renamed them with a one-liner. Enjoy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rename hosts in bulk by IP address:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;for x in 5,hosta 6,hostb 7,hostc 8,hostd; do IFS=&amp;#39;,&amp;#39; read -r a b &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; $x; ssh user@10.0.1.$a &amp;quot;sh -c \&amp;quot;sudo hostnamectl set-hostname ${b}.example.com\&amp;quot;&amp;quot;; done
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can also be adapted to force re-run cloud-init first time setup: &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;for x (5 6 7 8 9 10 11); do ssh user@10.0.1.$x &amp;#39;sh -c &amp;quot;sudo cloud-init clean --logs;sudo reboot now&amp;quot;&amp;#39;; done
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;36393986&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;36393986&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for reminding me that combining &lt;code&gt;read&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IFS&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; can be a powerful tool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I continue, I will introduce the members of Liella! who were present at the convention for those who may not be familiar with them. The three members are all part of the same subunit named &amp;quot;CatChu!&amp;quot;, an upbeat rock-type idol unit with powerful songs and a cute, catlike demeanor. They are: &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to sincerely thank Andy (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;yggdrizzle&quot;&gt;@yggdrizzle&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) and Julia (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;idol_trash&quot;&gt;@idol_trash&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) for their hard work in pulling together an incredible project to help everyone share their love of CatChu!. I also want to thank all the artists involved. Every piece of art contributed to the project was beautiful and were packed with love for CatChu!! Lastly, I want to thank everyone who contributed financially or otherwise to make the project a success!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this project was difficult and ambitious, but thanks to everyone&#x27;s hard work it came together in the nick of time to create a wonderful display of love for CatChu!! I&#x27;m honored to have been allowed to play a small part in constructing the display on-site, and hope to be able to lend a hand to more fan projects in the future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s no secret that the girls came and saw the banner and standees on the last day. They absolutely loved it, they looked thrilled and they took tons of photos! Hopefully we might see some of those photos one day. Our love for CatChu! was definitely conveyed to them!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also contributed financially to a flower stand project run by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;gs_sunshine&quot;&gt;Garden State Sunshine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It turned out really nice, but unfortunately I don&#x27;t have a picture of it! It looked amazing though! You can see it on twitter &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;gs_sunshine&#x2F;status&#x2F;1827038109764059549&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally I had planned to post a message in Times Square on the TSX screen to celebrate CatChu! coming to NYC, but I wasn&#x27;t able to get a timeslot. Since I wasn&#x27;t able to post it, I &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;timidtogekiss&#x2F;status&#x2F;1827797708951707782&quot;&gt;shared it on twitter&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and I&#x27;ll post it here too!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;event-report-anyc-2024&#x2F;times-square.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Times Square Banner for CatChu!&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;panels&quot;&gt;Panels&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#panels&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: panels&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CatChu! participated in several panels throughout the weekend, including their own panel on AnimeNYC&#x27;s second largest stage! The rooms were full and the crowd was swarming with energy and excitement every time they appeared! We certainly shocked them a bit with our reactions to their antics and with our overwhelming love and passion! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;event-report-anyc-2024&#x2F;panel-seat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A photo from my seat for CatChu!&#x27;s panel, with my Kanon-chan nesoberi and heart-shaped penlight!&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to secure seats near the stage for all three of their panels! I was really lucky! It&#x27;s not often that we get to see them up close, so I&#x27;m glad I was able to get such an opportunity. The girls spent a lot of time waving and interacting with their supporters from the stage, and I got quite a few waves, smiles, and hearts from Sayurin! It&#x27;s always such a rush to be recognized in the audience like that! It made me so happy!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were various questions asked to each of them from the staff, and one picked from the fans. I can&#x27;t summarize them all here because it&#x27;s been too long and I can&#x27;t quite remember all the answers, but to name a few we heard about their favorite scenes in &lt;em&gt;Love Live! Superstar!!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, their favorite insert songs, and key moments to watch out for during the screening of Ijigen Fes that took place after their appearance. Surprisingly to me, Sayurin&#x27;s favorite scene in Superstar is in Season 2 Episode 1 where Kanon-chan invites Kinako-chan to be a school idol. It&#x27;s an exceptionally sweet moment and one of my favorites as well, so I was really happy to hear that! Unsurprisingly, her favorite insert song from the anime was &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.spotify.com&#x2F;track&#x2F;0posBXcIeMLyjrYsSHR01P?si=35dc8ae1e7374cdf&quot;&gt;Mirai Yohou Hallelujah&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, where Kanon-chan is able to sing again for the first time!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interpreter did well to convey the meaning of each of the girls answers to the predominantly English speaking audience as well. I could understand about half of their answers without needing the translation, and the interpreter was right on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout it all, the members of CatChu! were constantly giggling and laughing in their seats, and weren&#x27;t nervous at all! We definitely took them by surprise a few times with our animated and boisterous reactions, but that made them all the happier! I know they made as many incredible memories as we did, and that makes me both happy and proud!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;odu-sihui-handover-event&quot;&gt;お渡し会 (Handover Event)&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#odu-sihui-handover-event&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: odu-sihui-handover-event&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big draws for many Liella! fans to AnimeNYC this year was that the three members of CatChu! would hold an &amp;quot;owatashikai&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;handover event&amp;quot;. These types of events consist of each idol handing you something (a postcard or a photograph) and a few seconds to talk one on one. They&#x27;re relatively infrequent even in Japan, and the ones held overseas are arguably even more special since a ticket guarantees meeting multiple idols instead of just one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;event-report-anyc-2024&#x2F;handover-ticket.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Handover Event Ticket&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After failing the pre-con lottery for the free owatashikai session, I was able to secure a ticket to the paid session by purchasing $100 worth of merchandise from the Bandai Namco Filmworks booth early on Friday morning. I was in!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-i-say&quot;&gt;What Do I Say...&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-do-i-say&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-do-i-say&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contemplated for weeks on what I was going to say to each of them. For Sayurin I knew my topic right away. I would tell her in person that I won a ticket to her birthday event at the end of September and that I was really looking forward to it. Normally that&#x27;s something I would&#x27;ve posted on twitter or instagram, but I kept silent on purpose to tell her at AnimeNYC. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Paychan and Yabu-chan, I wanted to bring up a topic from Liella!&#x27;s most recent fanmeeting tour. I had a few topics that I could choose from, but I decided that I would ask each of them to do a cute pose they referred to as a &amp;quot;kyurun&amp;quot; during the fanmeeting. It was super adorable at the fanmeeting, and I wanted to see it up close! I also wanted to tell them that I attended CatChu!&#x27;s fanmeeting in Aichi and the full group fanmeeting in K Arena.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my 4th time meeting Sayurin at an owatashikai, so I felt a little more at ease talking to her. I gained a lot of confidence after successfully speaking to her twice in Japan earlier this year. I was still super nervous, and I was shaking a bit in the line as I rehearsed what I was going to say. My Japanese ability isn&#x27;t very good in general, but gets even worse when I&#x27;m stressed or worried. I was certainly nervous thinking about meeting Paychan and Yabu-chan too. I was shaking a bit while talking to each of them, and at the end I thought I hadn&#x27;t taken Yabu-chan&#x27;s postcard. I had taken it, but I was so caught up in everything that I couldn&#x27;t remember if I had it with me. I hope they didn&#x27;t notice that I was shaking too badly. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had lots of other things to say to each of them, but I had to cut my conversations short while I was waiting due to the staff giving us much less time than the previous Love Live owatashikai I attended at Anime Expo in 2023. At AX, each person got about 15-20 seconds with each of the three members, and up to 30 seconds with one of the members if you had a clear and obvious favorite. The staff were very lenient with time at AX but were much stricter at AnimeNYC. I had about 10 seconds with each member of CatChu!, so I wasn&#x27;t able to say everything that I wanted to. I had to skip telling them that I went to the fanmeets, and I couldn&#x27;t ask Sayurin for a &amp;quot;kyurun&amp;quot;. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still treasure the memories of the event though! Getting to meet them one-on-one is nothing short of incredible! It&#x27;s always a dream come true!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;event-report-anyc-2024&#x2F;postcards.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Postcards from the Event&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to those near me in line for helping me stay calm. You know who you are. I&#x27;m glad we could help each other relaxed and enjoy these moments together!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m so grateful for the opportunity to meet each of them in New York! The members of CatChu! were overjoyed to see all of the foreign fans&#x27; happiness and passion for both them and Liella!!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the con, &lt;em&gt;LoveLive!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; staff ran the first ever &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Love Live! Superstar!!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; Intro Quiz&amp;quot;! We didn&#x27;t know what the quiz would be but it turned out to be a &amp;quot;name that tune&amp;quot; style quiz where the faster you answered the more points you earned. After ten questions, the top three contestants (who had a ticket), received a trophy directly from the members of CatChu!. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;event-report-anyc-2024&#x2F;quiz-ticket.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Intro Quiz Ticket&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to get a ticket for both rounds of the intro quiz! Tickets were distributed at 10:15am each morning, and only 50 tickets were available for each day. Though if you weren&#x27;t in line before 10am when the hall opened, you were unlikely to get a ticket. I&#x27;ll admit that was a little unfair, because if you weren&#x27;t an ANYC+ badge holder, an Exhibitor, or had an ADA accomodation you were unlikely to make it into the ticket line before the 50 person cap was reached.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it turned out that anyone could enter the quiz, but only ticket holders were able to actually collect a prize. This caused a bit of chaos with the leaderboards, but everything (mostly) worked out in the end. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coolest part was the members of CatChu! were actually present for the quiz! It was a little hard to focus on answering questions because their reactions to each song were super cute! They had no idea which songs would be played either, so everyone was able to see their reactions in real time! We were even treated to impromptu singing on occasion! During Yabu-chan&#x27;s solo song Akane Gokoro when Sayurin shoved the microphone in Yabu-chan&#x27;s face and she sung one of the lines. Sayurin was so happy that she wound up laying across the seat to put her head in Yabu-chan&#x27;s lap, still holding the microphone up to a confused and embarrassed Yabu-chan. Paychan eventually realized what was happening and laid across Sayurin to join in, it was so damn cute! Sayurin then proceeded to do the same thing to Paychan when the next song turned out to be Starry Prayer, one of her solos. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staff included a couple trick questions as well! Question 10 on Day 1 had everyone picking between the subunit versions of &lt;em&gt;What a Wonderful Dream!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, with CatChu!&#x27;s version being the correct answer. Most participants were correct. Day 2&#x27;s question was a bit more evil, asking everyone to pick between the three versions of 私のSymphony that have been released on CD: the original, 2022 version, and 2023 version (which released on CD in 2024, ironically). The fourth answer was the &amp;quot;2024 version&amp;quot; which doesn&#x27;t yet exist. A majority chose 2024, including myself and all three members of CatChu!! I can&#x27;t fault myself too much for that, I picked the highest number in the list in under a second when I realized it was the 2023 version, and only after clicking I realized that I had picked 2024. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to get 8&#x2F;10 correct both days, which wasn&#x27;t enough to place in the top 10. It was a lot of fun though! It definitely challenged my song title retention, and I hope I get another chance to participate in something like it some day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I&#x27;m lost for words trying to write about the amazing community of fans that I met this weekend. Many have been good friends to me for a while, and a majority I met for the first time. It didn&#x27;t matter if they were a &lt;em&gt;LoveLive!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; fan for 10 years or 10 days, everyone there was brimming with their love for Liella! and gratitude for the members of CatChu! for traveling so far to see us. At every event, big or small, everyone was buzzing with excitement and fixated on every moment we were able to spend with our idols. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our energy was almost overwhelming at times, physically propelling the members of CatChu! back in their seats when we got particularly excited. Judging by their reactions they weren&#x27;t expecting to fill the second largest stage at AnimeNYC with passionate, fervent fans cheering for them, overjoyed at the fact that their idols were in the same room. The members of CatChu! returned home certain that they weren&#x27;t simply known in the west; they were deeply loved. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone I met this weekend is reading this, I&#x27;m deeply grateful for the amazing memories you helped me create. I hope I was able to help you create amazing memories in the same way. It doesn&#x27;t matter if we spoke for three seconds or three days, seeing your passion and excitement for this franchise makes me happy beyond compare. I hope to see you all again at the next event, and I&#x27;d like to say お疲れ様でした, or thank you for your hard work. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;other-thoughts&quot;&gt;Other Thoughts&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#other-thoughts&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: other-thoughts&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some thoughts that I wanted to include in their own section that didn&#x27;t quite fit in above. They&#x27;re important to discuss though. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-that-could-ve-gone-better&quot;&gt;Things that Could&#x27;ve Gone Better&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#things-that-could-ve-gone-better&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: things-that-could-ve-gone-better&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard reports from others during the owatashikai who were allotted less than 10 seconds (sometimes only 5 seconds). There was no hard and fast rule given by the staff for how much time we would have, and enforcement seemed selective. This led to awkward moments with the members where their interpreters were still translating messages while fans were pushed along by the staff, leading to the members looking awkward and confused since they were unable to react properly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 150 tickets for each session, and the scheduled time was for the session was about one hour. Both sessions finished in under 45 minutes, so there was definitely enough time for those who were pushed onwards early to have their full session time. I would like to see the staff be more consistent in the future, and allow attendees to have &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a fixed bare minimum time to converse with each member. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the interpreters were also slower than others, so those who were able to speak Japanese were able to get more time with each of the members depending on the interpreter&#x27;s speed. From what I heard, they were all quite good at conveying messages and interactions were generally good, but I felt like I should call that out since some attendees weren&#x27;t able to get their messages out properly to CatChu! due to issues with interpreting. I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s really a fix for this as I recognize interpreting is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; difficult. But it was something I noticed. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-that-went-well&quot;&gt;Things that Went Well&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#things-that-went-well&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: things-that-went-well&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the owatashikai, here were several attendees who had mobility issues that would&#x27;ve prevented them from easily navigating the narrow line. They were allowed to go first, and the staff arranged for the members of CatChu! to come speak with them individually and hand over their postcards. This was a very wholesome moment, and I was very happy to see that everyone&#x27;s needs were considered in a very professional (and sweet) manner.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staff also had CatChu! enter and exit on opposite sides of the panel rooms, so all sections were able to interact up close with them!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusion&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was an absolutely incredible weekend. Thank you CatChu!, and thank you all. I had several dreams come true at AnimeNYC, and I know that many of the other attendees had their dreams come true as well. I know the members of CatChu! are headed back to Tokyo with our happiness and joy keeping their smiles bright and sparkling. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that Bandai Namco staff has seen our passion for Liella! and lets them return to the US again. I will pray for the day that Liella! can come as 11 members and perform for everyone overseas. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#x27;t wait for the next one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Coin Lockers and Where to Find Them</title>

&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&#x27;t go on a long rant about how the US and other western countries could benefit transit riders greatly by providing this simple service. Not here, anyway. I&#x27;ll just say that the car-brained mentality that those who are traveling will never need somewhere to store something for an hour or two is asinine. Then again, it&#x27;s not like the US or Canada to really expect you to, y&#x27;know, go anywhere without a car. But I digress.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coin lockers, or コインロッカー, do exactly what they say on the tin. They&#x27;re cheap, plentiful luggage storage often found in train stations, airports, neighborhoods and side streets. They come in a variety of sizes, from just large enough to fit a backpack to large enough to fit up to two pieces of rolling luggage (or an egregiously large one). Some even take other forms of payment (namely, IC cards).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m not going to bore you with the intricacies of different types of coin lockers or post a tutorial on how to use them. That is left as an exercise to the reader.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-you-came-here-for-how-to-find-a-coin-locker&quot;&gt;What you came here for: How to Find a Coin Locker&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-you-came-here-for-how-to-find-a-coin-locker&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-you-came-here-for-how-to-find-a-coin-locker&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to highlight Jun&#x27;s blog, because it has been a fantastic resource for me. It&#x27;s easy to find coin lockers while wandering, but for the longest time I had trouble trying to find reliable information about how many lockers were available at a particular station or how big they were. While the site is entirely in Japanese, it&#x27;s packed with useful info and maps to coin lockers at most major stations in Japan, as well as many smaller ones. Definitely worth checking out if you&#x27;re in need of a large locker. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Reflecting on 9 Years with Aqours</title>

        <summary>&lt;p&gt;Today marked the ninth anniversary of the creation of Aqours, the seiyuu idol group from the anime Love Live! Sunshine!! Each anniversary, Aqours would make announcements about their upcoming projects and release a new song as part of their fanclub (Aqours Club). It had become routine. This year seemed to be no different.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today marked the ninth anniversary of the creation of Aqours, the seiyuu idol group from the anime Love Live! Sunshine!! Each anniversary, Aqours would make announcements about their upcoming projects and release a new song as part of their fanclub (Aqours Club). It had become routine. This year seemed to be no different.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that this is their ninth anniversary. Nine is a symbolic number for Aqours and for the Love Live! franchise. The first Love Live! idol group, μ&#x27;s, was formed with nine members; their name a reference to the nine Muses from Greek mythology. Aqours followed suit, considering themselves &amp;quot;fully formed&amp;quot; when they reached nine members, working to create miracles as nine. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was announced that Aqours would hold &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7AGCpGnlGLY&quot;&gt;a livestream&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; at 8PM JST on the 30th with all 9 members present. This used to be standard practice before the pandemic but hasn&#x27;t happened in years. This raised alarm bells for some, but I believed that we were finally getting an announcement of a solo live performance (which Aqours hasn&#x27;t had since June 2022). I was right, but not in the way I hoped.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqours announced that their final solo live performance would take place within the next year. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I knew this day would come eventually, I wasn&#x27;t ready.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;nine-years&quot;&gt;Nine Years&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#nine-years&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: nine-years&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s hard to believe that nine years have passed since Aqours began. For nine years, the members of Aqours always pushed forwards to take on greater and greater challenges even though they were difficult. Their courage and determination led the Love Live! franchise to new heights and inspired the same courage in their fans all over the world. They inspired that same courage and determination within me, and I would not be the person I am today without their support. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a little strange to think about, but Aqours has been with me my entire adult life. They&#x27;ve been a constant source of joy and inspiration to me; through good times and bad, I&#x27;ve always had them by my side. Aqours helped me conquer some of the toughest times in my life with ease, their love and power helping my heart shine brightly along with theirs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, those nine years passed by in a flash. Despite their seemingly rapid pace, I wouldn&#x27;t trade my experiences with Aqours for anything. In the wake of the announcement of their final solo live countless memories came flooding back, reminding me that no matter how bad (or good) things seemed in the moment, the last nine years have been nothing short of extraordinary. I&#x27;m eternally grateful to the members of Aqours and to the friends I&#x27;ve made along the way for helping me create countless, incredible memories. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;memories&quot;&gt;Memories&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#memories&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: memories&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;aqours-9th-anniversary&#x2F;tickets.png&quot; alt=&quot;A collection of my Aqours event tickets&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;d like to share a few of my fondest memories with Aqours here. Don&#x27;t feel pressured to read them, but I want to share some of the Wonderful Stories I&#x27;ve experienced over the last nine years. They&#x27;re raw, poorly edited, and I may ramble a lot retelling them. But I think it&#x27;s important to share memories that Aqours helped us make, because no matter what happens those memories will always be with us. I don&#x27;t even know how many I&#x27;ll make it through writing while still trying to post this on the 30th. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might try to add more over the next couple days, as I think through and process things.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve been fortunate enough to see Aqours perform in person quite a bit though. I wouldn&#x27;t trade any of these experiences for anything. They&#x27;re some of my most precious memories. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;love-live.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aqours_World_Love_Live!_in_LA_~Beyond_the_Pacific~&quot;&gt;Information about Aqours World LoveLive! in LA ~Beyond the Pacific~&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a momentous occasion. The 2018 LA live marked the first time that Aqours (and Love Live! as a whole) held a one-man full-length live outside of Japan. Originally, I was supposed to fly out on vacation with my family that day, but with the biggest stroke of luck I was able to change my ticket and fly out a day later to make sure I didn&#x27;t miss seeing my first Aqours solo live. That was one of the greatest decisions I&#x27;ve ever made.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to surprise Aqours, a group of fans decided to organize a penlight project (where the whole crowd changes their penlight colors into a specific pattern at a certain time in a song). The goal was to form the sea of lights into a rainbow—the same rainbow that Aqours painted on their school upon its closure. The project was called the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AX_AquoRainbow&quot;&gt;AquoRainbow&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. During Anchan&#x27;s solo of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;love-live.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Yuuki_wa_doko_ni%3F_Kimi_no_Mune_ni!&quot;&gt;Yuuki wa doko ni? Kimi no Mune ni!&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, everyone would change their penlights to their assigned color of the rainbow based on their seat location. Each band of color would be raised one at a time, until all nine colors of the rainbow were represented.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;aqours-9th-anniversary&#x2F;rainbow.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Rainbow in the Love Live! Sunshine!! Anime&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seemed almost too ambitious. But we were determined to see it through. While waiting for the live to start, the person sitting next to me started asking about how the rainbow would work, and I remember explaining it to them. He wasn&#x27;t sure when we needed to do it, so I promised I&#x27;d clue him in when the time came. We were seated in the white color band, so my normally orange (and blue, at the time) penlights would switch to white when it was time for Anchan&#x27;s solo. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YuuKimi is a special song for me. Not only is it the ending song for Season 2 of Love Live! Sunshine!!, it&#x27;s a song that Aqours and the audience all sing together. It&#x27;s an incredibly powerful moment, joining our voices with theirs for one of the most beautiful songs ever released by the Love Live! franchise.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time came, and as we sang along with Aqours I started to wonder if it would be successful. And then, right on queue as Anchan began her solo, the entire crowd dropped their penlights below the seats and the front section instantly switched to purple. I knew it was going to work. One by one, each band of color rose up from the crowd. By the 6th color the members of Aqours realized what was happening, and began to cry. Anchan&#x27;s voice broke as she tried to keep singing while fighting back tears. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#x27;d done it. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;aqours-9th-anniversary&#x2F;rainbow-penlights.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Penlight Rainbow at Beyond the Pacific&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked to my right across the venue, and all I could see was a rainbow of color. I&#x27;ll never forget that moment as long as I live. I felt the international fanbase&#x27;s strong love for Aqours in that moment, and they felt it too. After the song finished, they remarked about how surprised they were, shouting their thanks through tears of joy. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the only image of the rainbow that exists is the image posted officially on twitter which I&#x27;ve included above. In the venue they claimed they were filming the entire performance to releases later, but to this day that footage has never been seen. One photo and our memories (and some bootleg cellphone video, which I will not link here) are all that remains of that magical moment in history.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;november-2018-aqours-4th-lovelive-sailing-to-the-sunshine&quot;&gt;November 2018 - Aqours 4th LoveLive! ~Sailing to the Sunshine!~&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#november-2018-aqours-4th-lovelive-sailing-to-the-sunshine&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: november-2018-aqours-4th-lovelive-sailing-to-the-sunshine&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#x27;t even begin to put my trip for Aqours 4th LoveLive! into an easily digestible context. After Beyond the Pacific, I told myself that there was no way I was going to miss the next major Aqours live taking place in November of that year. I had missed Aqours 1st through 3rd lives due to being a college student with limited income, but I decided that I would do whatever it took to get there for this one. Aqours 4th live was going to be one of the most important lives in the Love Live! franchise, as it was announced that it would be held in Tokyo Dome.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to how the number 9 is sacred in Love Live!, Tokyo Dome is the &amp;quot;holy grail&amp;quot; of venues for the franchise. In the Love Live! Sunshine!! anime, the finale of the Love Live! national school idol competition is held in Tokyo Dome (referred to as &amp;quot;Akiba Dome&amp;quot; in the show), and μ&#x27;s Final LoveLive! ~µ&#x27;sic Forever♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪~ was held on March 31 and April 1, 2016 at Tokyo Dome. Aqours making it to Tokyo dome by their 4th live was a massively momentous occasion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#x27;t have an e+ account, or even a Japanese phone number back then. The whole process seemed incredibly daunting, but I wanted to try to make it work. To my shock and surprise, Aqours 4th live was the first Love Live! event in history to have a foreigner ticket+hotel package. This bypassed my need for an e+ account, asn I could get a ticket officially through the package. I applied, and waited with baited breath to hear if I&#x27;d be selected from the ticket lottery.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being the first time they had done this, winning ticket emails were sent out one at a time by the travel agency staff by hand. The first email to someone in the r&#x2F;LoveLive discord came out early in the morning, and I finally received mine almost 12 hours later. 12 long hours of panic and pacing, but I had a ticket to Day 1 of Aqours 4th live. Not only that, I was going to Tokyo for the first time. I scalped a ticket for Day 2 off of TicketJam so I could attend both days, and I was set.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#x27;t really have strong ties with the international LL community at the time, but in the days leading up to my trip I wound up meeting a now close friend. We decided to hang out and walk around on my first day, and one by one we picked up other international livers to join our group. This tight-knit group of friends lasted into the pandemic, where due to life circumstances and (understandable) depression over the endless waves of cancellations we drifted apart. I&#x27;m hoping Aqours Finale will bring us back together one more time. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my 94 hour (yes, 94 hour) time in Japan, I experienced a whirlwind of emotion, culminating in one of the best lives I&#x27;ve ever been to. I can still replay both days of the live fully in my mind like I was there. The memories are as sharp as ever. I couldn&#x27;t hold back my tears across both days. It deserves its own blog entry some day reflecting on those moments. I can&#x27;t do it justice here. Not today, at least. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reaction-to-the-announcement&quot;&gt;Reaction to the Announcement&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#reaction-to-the-announcement&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: reaction-to-the-announcement&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find a good place to put this, so it gets its own section. I seriously didn&#x27;t think that this announcement was coming today. I laughed off the doom posts, thinking this would be an anniversary announcement like any other. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boy was I wrong. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each member introduced an announcement video as we all waited with baited breath, until it finally reached Anchan. She intro&#x27;d the video, and when it showed clips of Aqours&#x27; previous lives my heart sank. The words &amp;quot;Finale LoveLive!&amp;quot; flashed across the screen, and the penny dropped with a horrible clang. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anchan tried so hard to be strong, but as she read the announcement back to us she began to cry. Shuka gave her a rub on the back as she tried to push onwards with a smile. The fearless leader of Aqours kept pushing even though it was difficult, but the moment she began to cry I broke. It all felt real in that moment, even if later in the day it all felt like a bad dream. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-next&quot;&gt;What&#x27;s Next?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-s-next&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-s-next&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the announcement of their final solo live, Aqours isn&#x27;t disbanding. This will be their &amp;quot;Finale LoveLive!&amp;quot;, the last time they stand on a solo stage as the nine members of Aqours. They&#x27;ve already confirmed their JimoAi Matsuri in Numazu will return in 2025, likely after their finale live. In all honesty, Aqours will proceed similarly to how they&#x27;ve been the past two years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As reassuring as that news may be, it&#x27;s still heartbreaking. It&#x27;s the end of an era, and no amount of reassurance makes the news any less painful to bear. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ll be there for the last nine member performance of Aqours. No matter what. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ll do my best to push forward with a smile, knowing the members of Aqours are doing the same. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I can say now is, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.spotify.com&#x2F;track&#x2F;6nzcHFeAFXlupIslA5lxav&quot;&gt;Thank you, FRIENDS!!&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!--
Nine years has gone by in a flash. Somehow, today is already Aqours&#x27;s 9th anniversary, and its the 14th anniversary of the Love Live! series. Even though time has flown by so quickly, I have so many memories 

Aqours has been with me my entire adult life. 

My first trip to japan, my first ax, my first idol lives, all because of them.
made me into the person I am today. Wouldn&#x27;t be where I am without their support. 

Still remember my memories of Aqours clear as day. Like it was yesterday. Can replay all of 4th and 5th over in my head. The rainbow in 2018 forever burnt into my memory. 

Been wondering when this day would come for a while. It&#x27;s been 5 years since Aqours 5th live. Missed the lives during covid, including white day&#x2F;valentines. Glad I could see them at ijigen&#x2F;koshien. 
Still wasn&#x27;t ready.
Watching an aqours 9 member nama like the old days with friends, but this time it was endless announcements. 
When it finally got to Anchan, i was worried. And rightfully so, because that was the announcement I was silently dreading. 
She tried her hardest to hold back her tears, but once she started I couldn&#x27;t stop.
All my memories of Aqours came flooding back.
Even ones I hadn&#x27;t thought about in years.
All the friends I made, the ones I lost touch with along the way. Regrets, excitement, everything.


It&#x27;s not over yet, they&#x27;re not disbanding. But it&#x27;ll be their last solo live, and that&#x27;ll be heartbreaking.
I won&#x27;t miss it for anything.
Just like Anchan and Chika-chan always keep moving forward no matter how difficult the situation might be, I&#x27;ll continue to do the same. 
I&#x27;ll push forward with a smile, knowing the members of Aqours are doing the same.

        &lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ll be using Debian 12 in this post (the stable version at the time of writing) but these steps should be roughly the same for future versions of Debian.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;cloud-images&quot;&gt;Cloud Images&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#cloud-images&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: cloud-images&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debian offers several flavors of &amp;quot;cloud&amp;quot; disk images for use with various cloud vendors along with a &amp;quot;generic&amp;quot; image. These images can be direclty used as a VM disk on their respective platforms, offering a base install of Debian that can be customizable at runtime via cloud-init or a vendor specific configuration mechanism. The images are available &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdimage.debian.org&#x2F;images&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;&quot;&gt;on their site&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two flavors of Debian cloud images useful for a homelab are &amp;quot;generic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;genericcloud&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Genericcloud&amp;quot; lacks hardware driver support resulting in a smaller overall install size. Only use the &amp;quot;genericcloud&amp;quot; image if you know you will not need any generic hardware support (such as pci-e passthrough). In my experience, it&#x27;s been best to use the &amp;quot;generic&amp;quot; image with Proxmox. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;prepping-the-image&quot;&gt;Prepping the Image&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#prepping-the-image&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: prepping-the-image&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the latest generic or genericcloud .qcow2 image &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdimage.debian.org&#x2F;images&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;&quot;&gt; from the Debian site &lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to your local machine. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-shell z-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-function z-shell&quot;&gt;wget&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-arguments z-shell&quot;&gt; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdimage.debian.org&#x2F;images&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;bookworm&#x2F;&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-control z-regexp z-set z-begin z-shell&quot;&gt;[&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;VER&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-control z-regexp z-set z-end z-shell&quot;&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&#x2F;debian-12-genericcloud-&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-control z-regexp z-set z-begin z-shell&quot;&gt;[&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;ARCH&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-control z-regexp z-set z-end z-shell&quot;&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-control z-regexp z-set z-begin z-shell&quot;&gt;[&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;VER&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-control z-regexp z-set z-end z-shell&quot;&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;.qcow2&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qcow2 images aren&#x27;t compatible with Xen Orchestra or XCP-NG, so it needs to be converted to the VMDK format instead. On Linux, &lt;code&gt;qemu-img&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is capable of converting the disk for us, so install it &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pkgs.org&#x2F;search&#x2F;?q=qemu-img&quot;&gt;from your package manager&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to complete the next step. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-shell z-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-function z-shell&quot;&gt;qemu-img&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-arguments z-shell&quot;&gt; convert&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-parameter z-option z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-parameter z-shell&quot;&gt; -&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;f&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; qcow2&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-parameter z-option z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-parameter z-shell&quot;&gt; -&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;O&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; vmdk &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-assignment z-redirection z-shell&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;input&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-assignment z-redirection z-shell&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;.qcow2 &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-assignment z-redirection z-shell&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;output&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-assignment z-redirection z-shell&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;.vmdk&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This .vmdk image can be imported direclty into Xen Orchestra for use.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-templates&quot;&gt;Creating Templates&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#creating-templates&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: creating-templates&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xen Orchestra only exposes cloud-init configuration through a complete cloud-init ready template. Since Debian only provides a disk and not a full VM (.ova&#x2F;.ovf) template, the only way to get a working template is to create a VM and convert it to a template. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image provided from Debian has no root user password and no additional users configured, so any additional software modifications to the final template must be done in an intermediate stage which will be covered in a later step.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-the-base-cloud-init-template&quot;&gt;Creating the Base Cloud-init Template&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#creating-the-base-cloud-init-template&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: creating-the-base-cloud-init-template&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Xen Orchestra, import the .vmdk from the previous step as a disk. On the left-side menu, open the &amp;quot;Import&amp;quot; tab, and choose the &amp;quot;Disk&amp;quot; tab on the top right. Choose a Storage Repository (SR) to import to, and import the disk. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;debian-cloud-init-xen-orchestra&#x2F;import.png&quot; alt=&quot;Importing a .vmdk disk in Xen Orchestra&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After import, the .vmdk will appear in the available virtual disk inventory for the selected Storage Repository. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;debian-cloud-init-xen-orchestra&#x2F;vmdk-imported.png&quot; alt=&quot;Successfully imported the .vmdk&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, create a new VM, with the following properties (do not omit any):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use &lt;code&gt;PXE&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; boot&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete any existing disks&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced &amp;gt; Uncheck &lt;code&gt;Boot VM after creation&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;debian-cloud-init-xen-orchestra&#x2F;base-template-vm-creation.png&quot; alt=&quot;Creating the base template VM&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, under Disks on the newly created VM, attach the .vmdk imported previously. It&#x27;s also smart to rename the disk at this stage, but that&#x27;s not required.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;debian-cloud-init-xen-orchestra&#x2F;base-template-disk-attached.png&quot; alt=&quot;Attaching a disk to the base template&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, under Advanced set the boot order to Hard-Drive first (over PXE), and hit &amp;quot;Convert to Template&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;callout alert&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;div class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a good idea to &amp;quot;Clone&amp;quot; this VM at this point as creating a template is a one-way operation. It&#x27;s easier to roll back and fix a missed step with this intermediate clone, but it&#x27;s not required.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This template can now be launched with a cloud-init template to specify actions to be taken on first boot. The VM&#x27;s default disk size of 2GB can also be changed while the VM is off, and the filesystem will be automatically resized on the next boot to match the new size of the disk.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m currently deploying &lt;code&gt;xe-guest-utilities&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to all my VMs as it&#x27;s considered stable. There is a new &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xcp-ng.org&#x2F;forum&#x2F;topic&#x2F;7974&#x2F;new-rust-xen-guest-tools&quot;&gt;rust-based replacement&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; under active development &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;xen-project&#x2F;xen-guest-agent&quot;&gt;on gitlab&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and just underwent its 0.4 release. I&#x27;ll likely switch after a 1.0 release to give some more time for bugs to get ironed out. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;xe-guest-utilities&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is available &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xenserver&#x2F;xe-guest-utilities&#x2F;releases&quot;&gt;on github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a template with &lt;code&gt;xe-guest-utilities&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; preinstlaled, create a new VM using the template created in the last step. Make sure to supply a cloud-init configuration here, see &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mikansoro.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;debian-cloud-init-xen-orchestra&#x2F;#my-default-cloud-init-template&quot;&gt;my default template&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for how to configure a cloud-init VM for SSH access. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there are no guest tools by default, Xen Orchestra will not report the IP address of this VM in the console. If a password was set for one of the users configured by cloud-init, the ip address could be obtained by logging in via the VM console. I typically just &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; my DHCP range and login with SSH. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once logged in, download and install the guest tools .deb &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xenserver&#x2F;xe-guest-utilities&#x2F;releases&quot;&gt;from github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. and run &lt;code&gt;cloud-init clean&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to prime cloud-init to run again on the next boot. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the VM shuts down, remove the extra &amp;quot;cloud-init&amp;quot; disk that was added to the VM on creation, and convert it to a template. This is the final &amp;quot;production&amp;quot; template. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On all my VMs, I create a &amp;quot;break glass&amp;quot; local administrator user with a specialized keypair used only for this purpose, as well as a local ansible runner user with a separate keypair that I can use with any of my ansible playbooks. This lets me go straight from VM deployment to running an ansible playbook to finalize the system configuration without any manual intervention.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also updates all apt repositories and packages on first boot, which saves me some time later on (and makes sure I&#x27;m starting with the latest fixes).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use DHCP for all of my VMs and create static reservations for some, so I don&#x27;t bother with anything other than DHCP network configuration. A network config is &lt;em&gt;required&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for cloud-init. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Discussing the myriad of options for proxying public internet traffic into a homelab.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I began writing this post, it was supposed to be a quick run-through of how I proxy external traffic into my homelab. During the process though I&#x27;ve been answering questions from other homelabbers on the best way to achieve this for their setup, and have been benchmarking my own implementation to try and optimize it for my particular network. I&#x27;ll do my best to be brief while laying out all the options and testing that I&#x27;ve been going through for the past year. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In part one, I&#x27;ll discuss &lt;em&gt;why&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; it might be desirable to allow the public internet to reach parts of a homelab, talk about several options for doing so, and discuss various tradeoffs for each options. Future parts will cover my chosen implementation, along with configuration details and benchmarking. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that bit of housekeeping out of the way, let&#x27;s get started. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;let-the-internet-in-are-you-mad&quot;&gt;Let the Internet In? Are You Mad?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#let-the-internet-in-are-you-mad&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: let-the-internet-in-are-you-mad&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I really need to let the whole internet walk through my front door? It sounds a bit hyperbolic, but in broad terms that&#x27;s fundamentally what we&#x27;re discussing today. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#x27;t the case for everyone, but many homelabbers like myself run a variety of selfhosted services either for themselves, their family and friends, or the internet at large. Whether its to reduce dependence on cloud providers for services critical to modern life (file storage, email, web hosting, etc) or hosting something more fun (like a game server) these services require one critical component: users. The user pool may contain humans and&#x2F;or robots (read: other computers), but these users will all need to access the service &lt;em&gt;from&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; somewhere. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &lt;em&gt;from somewhere&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; portion is critical. While most selfhosted services only need to be accessible to those on a particular network, some services may need to be accessible from the internet at large. There is an inherent security risk in exposing a service to the internet, but that trade-off can be worth it. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s an example of a couple services I run, along with the type of access they require: &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publicly Accessible: Nextcloud
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I host a Nextcloud instance that allows me to both store files and share them with others. To facilitate sharing, I must be able to send links to those who aren&#x27;t on my VPN or local network. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessible over VPN: Home Assistant
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home Assistant logs environment data from several temperature&#x2F;humidity probes for historical purposes. I may want to check the temperature of my lab&#x27;s closet remotely, but the world does not. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local Network Access Only: dhcpd
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I run a &lt;code&gt;dhcpd&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; server at each of my sites, and this service should only ever be accessed by devices on the networks it controls the scopes for. It offers no features to a client on another network. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#x27;re going to tackle the &lt;code&gt;Publicly Accessible&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; use-case in this series. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;comparison-of-options&quot;&gt;Comparison of Options&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#comparison-of-options&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: comparison-of-options&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we&#x27;ve established why something running in a homelab might need to be accessible from outside the home network, let&#x27;s review some options for getting traffic into the network. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&#x27;t!&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a VPN, and connect to the service securely wherever I am.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a reverse proxy (like nginx or HAProxy) inside my network &amp;amp; port-forward on my router&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Cloudflare Tunnels to proxy traffic into my network via the Cloudflare network&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the service on a cloud provider, duh!&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a reverse proxy on a cloud provider, and tunnel back to my network from there&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ll break down each of these in turn, but I personally chose to run a reverse proxy on a cloud provider&#x27;s VPS and tunnel the traffic back to my network. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;don-t&quot;&gt;Don&#x27;t!&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#don-t&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: don-t&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one&#x27;s pretty self-explanatory. Selfhosted services don&#x27;t have to be exposed to the internet! In fact most services probably shouldn&#x27;t be exposed to the intenet at all. There are serious security risks involved in letting public, untrusted traffic hit your services. If you only ever need access from home, then feel free to keep it that way. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;host-a-vpn&quot;&gt;Host a VPN&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#host-a-vpn&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: host-a-vpn&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you (or a small group of trusted users) need access to your lab from anywhere, a VPN should be your first stop. While many of the public, third party &amp;quot;VPN&amp;quot; providers like Mullvad or NordVPN offer some kind of remote access solution, I&#x27;m referring to the classical definition of a Virtual Private Network that your &amp;quot;remote&amp;quot; roving clients (like a laptop or phone) and your servers at home are connected to. VPNs create a secure overlay network across the internet where clients can talk with each other as if they were directly connected.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many options for this, but I won&#x27;t go in-depth here. I&#x27;ll list a couple options&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Wireguard network&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host an OpenVPN server&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a third party mesh network manager like Tailscale&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create some fancy network topology using &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;slackhq&#x2F;nebula&quot;&gt;Nebula&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (cool project, mostly geared towards businesses) &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-cloudflare-tunnels&quot;&gt;Use Cloudflare Tunnels&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#use-cloudflare-tunnels&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: use-cloudflare-tunnels&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really need to expose a service to the public internet, a popular option among homelabbers is &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudflare.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;tunnel&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Cloudflare Tunnel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Cloudflare Tunnel a reverse-proxy and tunneling product from CLoudflare for exposing services to the internet via their network. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has some inherent benefits, as Cloudflare has PoPs (point of presence) in datacenters all over the world, offers a seemingly robust CDN (content delivery network) with DDoS protection, and tunnels are easy to configure. Plus, any attack against you is now an attack against Cloudflare, and they have a vested interest in mitigating that for you. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I have a few reasons against using them: &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&#x27;re not an existing Cloudflare customer (like me), there&#x27;s no automatic tie-in with their other services like DNS&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To use Cloudflare&#x27;s rule engine and WAF (web application firewall), you must use their TLS certificate between them and your clients. That means they can see all the unencrypted traffic bound for your tunnel. See &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;selfhosted&#x2F;comments&#x2F;132g8un&#x2F;comment&#x2F;ji4y4v8&#x2F;&quot;&gt;this reddit comment&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on r&#x2F;homelab for a nice explanation. 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, you can use Cloudflare Tunnels without their WAF&#x2F;proxy and host your own proxy at home with your own certificates. At that point, CF is just sending you the raw TCP connection, and you don&#x27;t benefit from their cloud-side attack mitigations. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up until 2024&#x2F;05&#x2F;16 it was actually &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;updated-tos&quot;&gt;against the Cloudflare ToS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to: &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] use the Services for serving video or a disproportionate percentage of pictures, audio files, or other non-HTML content [...], unless purchased separately as part of a Paid Service or expressly allowed under our Supplemental Terms for a specific Service.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ToS restriction was the main reason I didn&#x27;t go with Cloudflare tunnels. I&#x27;m planning to deploy some video and photo based services that need public access in the future, so if I was to breach the ToS I&#x27;d be opening myself up to unexpected downtime&#x2F;shut-offs of my tunneling system. However, if the removal of this ToS stipulation doesn&#x27;t bother you, and you&#x27;re comfortable letting Cloudflare inspect your traffic for their WAF and proxy services, it may be a good option for you. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;run-the-service-on-a-cloud-provider-vps&quot;&gt;Run the Service on a Cloud Provider&#x2F;VPS&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#run-the-service-on-a-cloud-provider-vps&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: run-the-service-on-a-cloud-provider-vps&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of running the service at home, running it on a cloud provider and having no tie-back to home is a totally valid option for some projects. It removes the potential security risk of opening up a home network to the internet, and the service wont go offline in the case of a local blackout or internet outage. However, it can be cost-prohibitive, especially if you need more CPU power or large bulk storage (for something like a media server), so it may or may not be viable depending on the specific use-case. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;run-a-reverse-proxy-at-home-and-port-forward&quot;&gt;Run a Reverse Proxy at Home and Port Forward&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#run-a-reverse-proxy-at-home-and-port-forward&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: run-a-reverse-proxy-at-home-and-port-forward&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a reverse proxy like HAProxy or Nginx is a common and good practice in the selfhosted world, as it provides a single convenient place for HTTPS certificate storage, TLS termination and access logging&#x2F;blocking of potentially malicious clients. Even if you&#x27;re not running a reverse proxy for the express purpose of handling external traffic, its a good idea. In this context though, to allow external traffic to reach an internal service requires creating a port-forward on your router to send traffic from a specified port (like 80&#x2F;443 for http&#x2F;s traffic) to your reverse proxy for evaluation and routing. This can be a good option if you have a static IP assigned by your ISP or when using a dynamic DNS service to continually point your DNS records to your service.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the act of having common ports open on the internet will be noticed by crawlers from companies like Google or Microsoft and internet search engines like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shodan.io&quot;&gt;shodan.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. If you don&#x27;t want your home&#x27;s public IP associated directly with the fact that you&#x27;re running web services there, that may be an issue. Another common issue is ISPs may unilaterally block ports (like 25 for SMTP) for residential connections, so that may prevent this from being a viable option in the first place. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;run-a-reverse-proxy-on-a-vps-and-tunnel-back&quot;&gt;Run a Reverse Proxy on a VPS, and Tunnel Back&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#run-a-reverse-proxy-on-a-vps-and-tunnel-back&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: run-a-reverse-proxy-on-a-vps-and-tunnel-back&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like running a single reverse proxy at home, this involves running a reverse proxy like Nginx or HAProxy, but this time on a cloud VPS. Traffic is then tunneled via any number of tunneling protocols such as OpenVPN, Wireguard or ssh. The reverse proxy could connect to a second reverse proxy on the other side of the tunnel, or directly to the services that need to be exposed. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This partially mitigates the danger of having ports wide-open on a home router, depending on the chosen configuration. This option also has the most complexity, as it requires securing both the VPS and the proxied services&#x2F;network manually. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several options for transport layers&#x2F;implementation include: &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many options for bringing external traffic into a homelab or private network environment, and I&#x27;ve barely scratched the surface here. It&#x27;s important to evaluate your particular situation and select a method that makes sense for you. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post, I&#x27;ll talk about the implementation that I&#x27;ve been running for the last year, and then dive into optimizations, changes, and upgrades. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <summary>&lt;p&gt;I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be saying this today but, goodbye Foursquare. As of 8:00-ish this morning PDT, my time at Foursquare came to an abrupt end.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize if I ramble a bit below. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-bittersweet-moment&quot;&gt;a bittersweet moment&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-bittersweet-moment&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-bittersweet-moment&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foursquare&#x27;s Infrastructure Engineering team was comprised of an absolutely wonderful, talented group of individuals who I&#x27;m happy to be able to call friends. Each of them taught me so much and together we were able to build some truly amazing platforms and projects. Our internal development platforms were mature, comprehensive, and constantly improving; managed by people who cared deeply about making them as user-friendly and intuitive as possible. I will miss the shared camaraderie and passion our team had to constantly make Foursquare a better place to work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly value my time and experience working alongside them and am sad that, at least for the moment, those times have come to an end. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish my team smooth sailing on the seas ahead. It sounds like it will be a demanding path, but I know they&#x27;re up to the challenge. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same sentiment extends to the entire engineering organization at Foursquare. Engineering at Foursquare was full of talented people who were passionate about their work and always willing to collaborate and learn together. I wish everyone I had the pleasure to work with the very best. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;things-i-worked-on&quot;&gt;things I worked on&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#things-i-worked-on&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: things-i-worked-on&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Foursquare I spent an outsized effort to ensure that our internal platforms were robust, featureful and easily self-serviceable by their consumers. While some of those projects still remain outstanding, I remain happy with the work I was able to accomplish in pushing forward the velocity of the engineering organization.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to kill off a few legacy systems too, some of which were created so long ago they had long-surpassed the point of having only a single-digit candle on their birthday cakes. Each of them posed interesting new technical challenges and helped me learn new things. Every day spent unraveling those systems&#x27; ancient arcana which had been lost to the sands of time (and Slack history) was an absolute pleasure. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to say thanks to those who put up with my (sometimes janky) ideas, and helped me refine them and see them through. I&#x27;m glad we were able to build cool things together, and stop the old things from paging us in the middle of the night. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-me-excerpt&quot;&gt;about-me excerpt&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#about-me-excerpt&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: about-me-excerpt&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ll have to update the about-me page on this blog now, but because what I&#x27;d written makes me chuckle I&#x27;ve immortalized it on this page.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m currently an Infrastructure Engineer&#x2F;&amp;quot;SRE&amp;quot; at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foursquare.com&#x2F;about-us&quot;&gt;Foursquare&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. 
Yes, Foursquare. That oft-forgotten Yelp competitor that everyone used back in 2012 to find places to eat and things to do. 
Foursquare is still around, and so is the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foursquare.com&#x2F;city-guide&quot;&gt;City Guide&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; you remember from back then. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Foursquare I work primarily with Kubernetes, helping teams migrate their workloads and ensuring our internal platforms are robust, featureful, and user-friendly. 
I love modernizing the old arcana within our tech stack; taking components with design decisions lost to the sands of time and bringing them into the modern age. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-s-next&quot;&gt;what&#x27;s next&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-s-next&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-s-next&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s next for me on the horizon. But whatever it is, I&#x27;ll try to build something cool out of it. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, and godspeed to those I was fortunate enough to call colleagues. I hope we can work together again some day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Bromide and Postcard Paper Sizes</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s a quick reference for how typical Japanese bromide sizes relate to international photo paper sizes in different regions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bromide_(Japanese_culture)&quot;&gt;Bromides&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are photo prints, usually portraits of idols and other celebrities, and are often found in certain parts of Japanese fandom and collection culture. They are still very common and popular in the idol industry; where they are sold directly to fans, included as pre-order or purchase bonuses, or used to commemorate a special or notable event. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectible postcards are also distributed similarly to bromides, the difference being that postcards are printed on cardstock while bromides are printed on photo paper. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When trying to frame some of my bromides for display I had a bit of trouble searching for a frame that would fit appropriately. I&#x27;ve been using photo albums that I purchased in Japan to store my collection, which naturally are sold in common bromide&#x2F;Japanese photo paper sizes (L, 2L, etc). Trying to find dimensions for frames was a bit more difficult until I stumbled across the handy table below. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data below comes from Wikipedia&#x27;s &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Photo_print_sizes#Overview&quot;&gt;excellent photo paper size chart&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Here&#x27;s an abridged version for common bromide sizes. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though a photo frame is advertised as a particular size, most photo frames will come with a minor crop. This usually isn&#x27;t an issue for framing bromides, but if your bromide has text or some other element at the edge it may become a problem. Look for &amp;quot;Digital Compatible&amp;quot; photo frames or a larger frame with a no-crop mat as an alternative. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Manual Fanspeed Control through IPMI</title>
		<published>2024-04-27T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2024-04-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://mikansoro.org/blog/ipmi-fan-control/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://mikansoro.org/blog/ipmi-fan-control/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, enterprise compute and networking gear from large vendors (Dell, Supermicro, HPE, Cisco, etc) use dynamic fanspeed controls based on system temperature to ensure their vital components remain at a safe operating temperature.
That&#x27;s all well and good in the datacenter space where increased cooling capacity far outweighs an increase in noise.
Likewise, sufficient cooling potential is provided by the ambient temperature delta between the cold and hot aisles, letting the BMC simply ramp fan speeds up as users push the hardware ever closer to the redline.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a homelab though, the calculus changes. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those fortunate enough to own a basement—one that doesn&#x27;t flood when it rains—can care less when the natural cooling properties of a subterranean room plus decent sound isolation keep their servers running happily as they were designed. 
For the rest of us who wish to take advantage of enterprise-grade gear but live in a space-restricted dwelling, we must trade some cooling performance for a reduction in noise to stay sane.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my lab, I regularly run my server fans at 16-20% their maximum operating speed. 
I&#x27;m rarely stressing my systems above 15% utilization under normal operation for any significant period, and this range provides a workable cooling-to-noise ratio such that I don&#x27;t feel like my ears are going to start bleeding when I open my server closet. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But enough blabber. Let&#x27;s talk solutions. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ll update this post with more vendors as I come across them, but as my lab is largely composed of Supermicro gear due to their less-uptight nature around vendor-specific hardware (&lt;em&gt;cough cough HPE&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;), updates will likely be few and far between. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;ipmitool&quot;&gt;ipmitool&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#ipmitool&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: ipmitool&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ipmitool&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is a command-line tool for interacting with both the host-local and remote IPMI BMCs. It&#x27;s largely used by sysadmins to administer low-level server function across a fleet, but it&#x27;s a good back-pocket tool for homelabbers too. In the case of making servers quiet, ipmitool allows for bypassing the lack of proper fanspeed controls in IPMI management web UIs by interfacing directly with the BMC. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every fan controller implementation is a bit different, so the ultimate source of information for which commands work on what platform would be the vendor&#x27;s specific documentation. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;supermicro-ipmi&quot;&gt;Supermicro IPMI&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#supermicro-ipmi&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: supermicro-ipmi&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use ipmitool to connect to a remote Supermicro IPMI interface, run &lt;code&gt;ipmitool&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; with the following flags. &lt;code&gt;-P&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is optional, and an interactive password prompt will appear if it is ommitted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supermicro fan controls consist of two zones, &amp;quot;system&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;peripheral&amp;quot;. System fans are fans identified with a number (&lt;code&gt;FAN0&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;), and peripheral fans (like hot-swappable power supplies) are identified by letter (&lt;code&gt;FANA&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;).
Supermicro provides four fan profiles to users: &amp;quot;Standard&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Full&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Optimal&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Heavy IO&amp;quot;. The definitions of these zones are provided below, but they come from &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.servethehome.com&#x2F;index.php?resources&#x2F;supermicro-x9-x10-x11-fan-speed-control.20&#x2F;&quot;&gt;this great ServeTheHome post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; about controlling fans on the Supermicro x9-x11 platforms.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard: BMC control of both fan zones, with CPU zone based on CPU temp (target speed 50%) and Peripheral zone based on PCH temp (target speed 50%)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimal: BMC control of the CPU zone (target speed 30%), with Peripheral zone fixed at low speed (fixed ~30%)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full: all fans running at 100%&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heavy IO: BMC control of CPU zone (target speed 50%), Peripheral zone fixed at 75%&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To manually set the fan speed to a fixed target, the fans must be set to use the &amp;quot;Full&amp;quot; profile. Other profiles will ignore the manual target speed commands we issue to the BMC.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the fan controls here use &amp;quot;raw&amp;quot; ipmi commands with seemingly magic numbers. For instance, here&#x27;s the command to set the system to use the &amp;quot;Full&amp;quot; fan profile: &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-shell z-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-begin z-shell&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt; set the system to use the &amp;quot;Full&amp;quot; fan profile&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-begin z-shell&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt; [args] are the connection arguments listed above&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-function z-shell&quot;&gt;ipmitool&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-arguments z-shell&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-control z-regexp z-set z-begin z-shell&quot;&gt;[&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;args&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-control z-regexp z-set z-end z-shell&quot;&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; raw 0x30 0x45 0x01 0x01&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-begin z-shell&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;                                     ^ Fan profile value&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final hex value in the command above is the fan profile for the system to use.
&lt;code&gt;0x01&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; designates the &amp;quot;Full&amp;quot; profile. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard: 0&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full: 1&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimal: 2&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heavy IO: 4&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the fans are set to &amp;quot;Full&amp;quot;, each fan group&#x27;s PWM duty cycle can be set to a percentage value of 0-100%, using the hex values &lt;code&gt;0x00&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;0x64&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. 
Time for more magic numbers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the Supermicro section above, we can set a fixed target PWM speed percentage through issuing &amp;quot;raw&amp;quot; commands to our BMC. It&#x27;s the same two-step process, first setting the fans to their &amp;quot;Full&amp;quot; profile, and then adjusting the PWM duty cycle to our desired value. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;These are the commands to control the fans on a Dell r710. Subsequent versions of Dell R-series server iDRACs may have different values. Consult your system&#x27;s documentation for a full list of options.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-shell z-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-begin z-shell&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt; Set fan profile&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting the fan percentage is similar to the Supermicro example, where we pass a percentage value to lock the fans to a particular speed. However, there are no separate zones, and at the time of writing I don&#x27;t know the actual percentage curve. &lt;code&gt;0x08&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;0x10&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; are reasonable for sitting in the same room while offering acceptable cooling performance in environments where the system isn&#x27;t under heavy stress. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-shell z-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-begin z-shell&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt; Set fan percentage&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;This post assumes the reader has a working understanding of AWS IAM, including the differences between IAM users and roles, how roles are assumed&#x2F;used, and their purpose in the IAM ecosystem.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-does-this-even-matter&quot;&gt;Why does this even matter?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-does-this-even-matter&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-does-this-even-matter&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve encountered several instances where a service&#x2F;job&#x2F;pod&#x2F;what-have-you running in an AWS EKS cluster needed to assume multiple AWS roles to accomplish its task. Typically, when a pod needs access to several resources (say, several s3 buckets, an AWS Redshift cluster, and an Athena&#x2F;Glue crawler in a different account from the EKS cluster), common sense dictates we should create a role specifically for that pod to assume and call it a day. This is a fine pattern, and its a good practice to separate roles meant for assumption by humans from roles meant for robots anyhow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are scenarios where it may not be practical or desirable to create a monolithic role for a specific task. That could be for a myriad of reasons, such as migrating legacy workflows into Kubernetes, using roles that connect to partner&#x2F;client AWS resources not under your control, or not granting cross-account resource access for roles. Some resources, like AWS Glue and AWS Secrets Manager, don&#x27;t behave the same way during cross-account access.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-a-single-role-isn-t-always-feasible-for-a-pod-have-an-example&quot;&gt;So a single role isn&#x27;t always feasible for a pod. Have an example?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-a-single-role-isn-t-always-feasible-for-a-pod-have-an-example&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-a-single-role-isn-t-always-feasible-for-a-pod-have-an-example&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I tried to run an ansible playbook inside a Kubernetes cronjob, while maintaining the playbook&#x27;s ability to be run by humans (who all use a standardized set of AWS profiles, that&#x27;s important later). Ideally, both human operators and robots should be able to use the playbook without any code changes. The playbook uses two profiles, named &lt;code&gt;account-a-admin&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;account-b-admin&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. All humans who need to run this playbook locally have &lt;code&gt;account-a-admin&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;account-b-admin&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; profiles defined already in their AWS config file (&lt;code&gt;~&#x2F;.aws&#x2F;config&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;), and each profile assumes a role role in either account &lt;code&gt;a&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;b&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; respectively. These admin roles are powerful, and not something that should be handed out lightly (and never assumed by robots). &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that still doesn&#x27;t explain why we can&#x27;t create new role used solely by this pod, granting the specific access required to execute the playbook. Well, because this playbook operates on ec2 instances, it uses the &lt;code&gt;aws_ec2&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; dynamic inventory plugin. For the inventory plugin to work properly for human users, an AWS profile name must be passed as part of the configuration. Normally, we could override profile names with ansible extra vars (using the &lt;code&gt;-e&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; command line flag) or by using a jinja2 template to look up the value from an environment variable. Sounds simple, right? &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong. Some dynamic inventory plugins respect extra vars, but are not required to. They also don&#x27;t support jinja2 templates. You can see where I&#x27;m going with this. There isn&#x27;t a way to dynamically select a profile for the &lt;code&gt;aws_ec2&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; dynamic inventory. Therefore, we need to create AWS config profiles with credentials that will satisfy the inventory plugin. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;okay-you-need-to-make-aws-config-profiles-so-that-s-common&quot;&gt;Okay, you need to make AWS config profiles. So? That&#x27;s common.&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#okay-you-need-to-make-aws-config-profiles-so-that-s-common&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: okay-you-need-to-make-aws-config-profiles-so-that-s-common&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s the impetus behind me writing this. Most engineers who have written AWS config files before have only used them with static credentials stored in &lt;code&gt;~&#x2F;.aws&#x2F;credentials&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, then used those credentials to assume a role. Instead, we can adapt the AWS config with some lesser-known options assume roles granted to pods through EKS, without defining static credentials. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-irsa-works&quot;&gt;How IRSA Works&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-irsa-works&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-irsa-works&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before we get too deep, here&#x27;s a brief overview on how IAM integrates with Kubernetes in AWS. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, a workload running in Kubernetes will need to access some resource outside the cluster to perform its task. For the sake of example, we&#x27;ll assume that we have a pod running inside EKS, AWS&#x27;s cloud Kubernetes distribution. This pod needs to access some files in s3, but it was deemed too risky to stash a non-expiring IAM keypair inside a kubernetes secret and call it a day. Instead, we can grant a pod the temporary credentials required to assume an IAM role through AWS &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;opensource&#x2F;introducing-fine-grained-iam-roles-service-accounts&#x2F;&quot;&gt;IAM roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; feature.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRSA works by allowing the exchange of Kubernetes service account OIDC JWT tokens with IAM for set of temporary IAM credentials corresponding to a role. This requires both an &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;registry.terraform.io&#x2F;providers&#x2F;hashicorp&#x2F;aws&#x2F;latest&#x2F;docs&#x2F;resources&#x2F;iam_openid_connect_provider.html&quot;&gt;IAM OIDC Connect Provider&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to be created using the cluster OIDC issuer&#x27;s URL and thumbprint, and the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws&#x2F;amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook&quot;&gt;eks pod identity mutating admission webhook&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. When a Kubernetes service account with the &lt;code&gt;eks.amazonaws.com&#x2F;role-arn: &amp;lt;arn&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; annotation is attached to a pod, the pod identity webhook injects a token via a projected &lt;code&gt;serviceAccountToken&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; volume and sets several environment variables. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this token, the pod can then call the AWS SecurityTokenService (STS) api to exchange the the token for a set of IAM credentials, using the &lt;code&gt;AssumeroleWithWebIdentity&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; action. Modern versions of the AWS SDK will see the &lt;code&gt;AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; environment variable and automatically assume the role on startup. For instance, the AWS cli command &lt;code&gt;aws sts get-caller-identity&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; will return a role session for the role specified in the service account annotation instead of a role session for the underlying host node role when the service account is attached. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate what is added by the pod identity webhook, see the following diff. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we&#x27;ve established that role credentials provided thorugh the EKS pod identity webhook are WebIdentity roles, and credentials are granted through the &lt;code&gt;AssumeroleWithWebIdentity&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; STS api. While the AWS SDK and cli will automatically detect the environment variable and assume the role, that does not extend to profiles. For example, if we call &lt;code&gt;aws sts get-caller-identity --profile default&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; from within our EKS pod, the command will exit with an error that no config profile was found with the name &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;. Which makes sense, since we haven&#x27;t defined one in the config file yet. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging through the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;awscli.amazonaws.com&#x2F;v2&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;api&#x2F;latest&#x2F;topic&#x2F;config-vars.html&quot;&gt;AWS cli config reference&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, there&#x27;s a section for options relating to AssumeroleWithWebIdentity. We can create a profile that takes a web identity token file and role arn, and the SDK will automatically call STS on our behalf to retrieve credentials for the role. Since our token is automatically injected into the pod using a volume and because we know the mount path, this config becomes pretty trivial. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;conf&quot; class=&quot;language-conf z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-conf&quot; data-lang=&quot;conf&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-genconfig&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-comment z-genconfig&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-genconfig&quot;&gt;# In ~&#x2F;.aws&#x2F;config

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, calling &lt;code&gt;aws sts get-caller-identity --profile default&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; will produce the same result as not providing a profile. We&#x27;re now assuming the role the same as the SDK does without a config file, but in a more explicit way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can take this a couple steps further though, and chain several role assumptions together. This unlocks a tremendous amount of power when working with multiple roles: &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we call &lt;code&gt;aws sts get-caller-identity --profile account-b-specialized&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; now, the AWS SDK will automatically chain the assumption of all three roles and return a set of credentials matching the &lt;code&gt;arn:aws:iam::567890123456:role&#x2F;special-s3-access&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; role. Not only that, but the SDK now has a template on how to automatically refresh these role credentials when they&#x27;re close to expiring, without having to call STS ourselves or write any code that creates or manages AWS sessions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;bonus-points-kubernetes-best-practices&quot;&gt;Bonus Points: Kubernetes Best Practices&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#bonus-points-kubernetes-best-practices&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: bonus-points-kubernetes-best-practices&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of injecting this AWS config into your container at build time, create a Kubernetes configmap with the AWS config and mount it inside the pod using a volume. Commit these manifests to your kubernetes source control repository (you have one, don&#x27;t you?), that way other engineers very explicitly know what roles are being consumed by this particular workload, and they can be easily adapted down the line.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;should-i-use-this&quot;&gt;Should I use this?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#should-i-use-this&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: should-i-use-this&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, that comes down to your use case and the organization you work in. If your code (script in a cronjob, Airflow DAG, web microservice, etc) can operate off of a single AWS role that can be directly assumed by the pod, then no, don&#x27;t bother. Continue using web identity role assumption directly through the SDK as you have been and move on with life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need multiple roles for different actions, run with an ancient SDK, or need to maintain code execution compatibility between different types of systems as I had, then this might be an easy solution. Sure, it&#x27;s possible to write some code against boto3 to assume multiple roles and auto-refresh their credentials before every operation if they&#x27;re close to expiring. You can gate that code to only running in specific execution environments too. Or, you can offload all that work (and brittleness) to the AWS SDK, and let it do its job handling credentials for you. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put it this way, do you really want to be parsing temp files to check the credential expiry time with &lt;code&gt;jq&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; every time your bash script needs to connect to s3, and renew them if they&#x27;re close to expiring? I certainly wouldn&#x27;t.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please Note:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;This post details my own personal testing with using Japan TTP cards for tax-free purchasing, as well as the most up-to-date information that I&#x27;m aware of from the Japan Ministry of Justice (MOJ). This post will continue to be updated over time as I test more stores and refine my testing methodology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-the-ttp&quot;&gt;About the TTP&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#about-the-ttp&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: about-the-ttp&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan Trusted Traveler Program (TTP) cards are similar to Global Entry cards in the US, they allow cardholders to use automated customs and immigration gates instead of having to interact with a passport control agent. Instead of a Landing Permission stamp (which is actually a sticker), the back of the card is printed with a line indicating the entry&#x2F;exit status of the cardholder. The card becomes your landing permission instead.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;japan-ttp-card-sample.png&quot; alt=&quot;A sample of the Japan TTP card from the MOJ.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a handy thing to have for frequent travelers as the line for immigration can get quite long depending on the time of day. Because the card is your legal entry document into Japan, you&#x27;re not required to carry your passport with you at all times (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.moj.go.jp&#x2F;isa&#x2F;publications&#x2F;materials&#x2F;ttp2_q_a_faq_a_ja.html#qkiso-37-a&quot;&gt;MOJ FAQ&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). Carrying your passport is still a good idea regardless, however when the TTP card is used for entry it is not required. If you enter Japan without using your TTP card at the automated kiosk, you are required to carry your passport at all times to prove your lawful status in the country.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#x27;re interested in getting a TTP card, user @flammenkrieg_au in the r&#x2F;LoveLive discord wrote a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1yvdlbKxcGKdFyPHoJCcs9ZvfMdD037TzL_f0A6WKbCM&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;comprehensive guide to the application process&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;purchasing-tax-free-with-a-ttp-card&quot;&gt;Purchasing Tax-Free with a TTP Card&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#purchasing-tax-free-with-a-ttp-card&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: purchasing-tax-free-with-a-ttp-card&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted at the bottom of flammenkrieg&#x27;s guide, Tax Free purchases normally require a Landing Permission stamp. Most stores use an iPad-based app to submit tax-free paperwork, which prompts the cashier to scan the photo page of the passport and the QR code of the currently valid Landing Permission stamp. Most people are unaware that the TTP card even exists, let alone the fact that it&#x27;s valid as a temporary visitor authorization record instead of the normal passport stamp.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per the MOJ&#x27;s documentation on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nta.go.jp&#x2F;publication&#x2F;pamph&#x2F;shohi&#x2F;menzei&#x2F;201805&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;0023004-052_03.pdf&quot;&gt;Persons eligible for Duty-Free Sales&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, holders of the TTP card who have used it to enter Japan are considered eligible, however without the stamp you may be ineligible to prove your short-term status at the tax-free store. It&#x27;s stated that you can inform an immigration officer before after passing through the automated gate &lt;em&gt;and&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; before customs inspection that you need a stamp for tax-free purposes (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nta.go.jp&#x2F;publication&#x2F;pamph&#x2F;shohi&#x2F;menzei&#x2F;201805&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;0021009-040_13.pdf&quot;&gt;JP&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nta.go.jp&#x2F;publication&#x2F;pamph&#x2F;shohi&#x2F;menzei&#x2F;201805&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;0021009-040_13.pdf&quot;&gt;EN&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). More testing is required to understand if this is viable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds confusing, that&#x27;s because it is. The TTP program is not well known both inside and outside Japan. It&#x27;s so poorly known and advertised that staff inside the immigration hall will likely direct you to the incorrect line if you show them the card and ask where to go. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When attempting to make tax-free purchases with my TTP card, I hand the cashier both my passport and the card to the cashier at the same time. I open my passport to the picture page and place the TTP card rear-side up (where the landing permission is printed) inside the passport. This ensures some amount of consistency when interacting with store staff regardless of their prior training.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve started trying to explain to cashiers that the back of my TTP card is my entry document, not a stamp in my passport. This includes using Google Translate&#x2F;DeepL to explain the back of the card.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also include reports from others, either anonymously or with attribution where allowed. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Success: 2024&#x2F;02&#x2F;09
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was able to successfully purchase an item tax-free using my TTP card at the 5th floor register near the escalator. Bic does not use the newer iPad app system to process tax-free purchases, they have a custom system built into their registers. The cashier did double-take upon receiving my card, however once he read the &amp;quot;Temporary Visitor&amp;quot; print line on the rear of the card (aka, what serves as my &amp;quot;stamp&amp;quot;), he entered that information into the register along with a scan of my passport to complete the transaction. The process was largely seamless, and no questions were asked.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure: 2024&#x2F;02&#x2F;13
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon handing the cashier my passport and TTP card, I saw them reach for the iPad on the back shelf and knew this one might be trouble. The staff immediately moved my TTP card out of the way and disregarded it, and despite my limited attempts to explain that the card would be necessary (with limited Japanese speaking ability and no preparation), he proceeded to try and scan my passport regardless. Eventually I was able to draw his attention to the landing permission on the back of the card. He then tried to scan it with the app (instead of the normal landing permission stamp&#x27;s QR code), however this failed. I&#x27;m not sure if it failed due to the angle at which he tried to photograph it (there was quite a bit of glare from the store lighting from what I could see on screen) or if the app failed to recognize the card, more testing is required on that. The staff then found a Landing Permission stamp from a previous trip, scanned that, and it was considered valid to complete the transaction. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I handed both my passport and TTP card to the cashier and showed the staff a translation that I did not have a stamp in my passport and that the back of the card served as my temporary visitor entry document. After going through all the stamps in my passport anyway, the cashier read both sides of the card. The cashier then started digging through the iPad app and eventually found some sort of &amp;quot;manual entry&amp;quot; function. They entered the information from my card entry stamp as my time of entry and proceeded with the transaction as normal. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Success: 2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;10
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all Pokemon Centers in Japan will do tax-free purchases (like the Mega Tokyo location in Ikebukero), but the DX Tokyo one does. DX Tokyo does not use the newer iPad app system, they use a system built into their register that requires scanning the photo page with a barcode reader and manually entering th epassport holder&#x27;s arrival date in Japan. I handed the cashier my passport and TTP card, showed them both the front and back of the card, and pointed to the arrival log on the back of the card. She read the card asked if I could wait a moment. She took my card and passport into a back room behind the registers. After about 5 minutes, the cashier returned with a manager and the cashier input my passport information into the register. The cashier returned my passport and TTP card to me, but the manager then called over another cashier and asked for my TTP card back. They explained what the card was and the tax-free process to the other cashier. The manager was definitley familiar with the TTP card and knew what it was. The manager then returned my card, and the transaction was completed. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;This purchase was made at the video game register on the 6th floor of Yodobashi. Yodobashi does not use the newer iPad app tax free system, they use a system built into their register that requires scanning the photo page of the passport with a barcode reader and manually entering the passport holder&#x27;s date of arrival. I gave the cashier my passport along with my TTP card face down, pointing to the entry stamp on the back of the card. After some visible confusion, flipping through all my stamps and reading the front of the TTP card, he consulted their internal rules binder for tax-free purchases. Not finding enough information, they made several phone calls in the back of the register area. Finally, the staff seemed satisfied that the tax-free purchase could proceed, and they called another employee over to explain the TTP tax free process to them.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Success: 2024&#x2F;05&#x2F;05
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was tested by @coreymon77 on Discord. They handed their card and passport together to the cashier. The cashier looked through the passport to find a stamp, and when unsuccessful, read the back of the card. They didn&#x27;t check the front of the card, it was enough that there was a card that said &amp;quot;Temporary Visitor&amp;quot; and had a date on it. They entered the data into the register and proceeded with the transaction.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few things I noticed while flying one of the newest Delta A330-900s. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently flew on one of the newest Delta Airlines A330-900s in their fleet at the time of writing, tail number &lt;code&gt;N427DX&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. This aircraft was delivered to Delta in December 2023, making it approximately one month old. While I don&#x27;t intend this to be a review by any means, I wanted to document a few of the things I found interesting about the aircraft and the service aboard. It may read like a review to some, but this is as much for my own future reference as yours, dear reader. I&#x27;m not going to offer any conclusions here. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a disclosure, this is my first time flying Delta since before the pandemic; I don&#x27;t have allegiance to any airline in particular, but my most-often traveled airlines include United, American, ANA, and Alaskan Airlines. I tend to fly whoever has the lowest price with the right departure time. I&#x27;m currently considering deepening my relationship with Star Alliance carriers via United&#x27;s MileagePlus program, but I&#x27;m currently undecided and will likely post an update if&#x2F;when I reach a conclusion detailing my rationale.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-decent-place-to-sit&quot;&gt;A Decent Place to Sit&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-decent-place-to-sit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-decent-place-to-sit&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta&#x27;s Economy cabin on the A330-900 is a 2-4-2 configuration, a rare sight for me as I normally travel on the 787 and its 3-3-3 layout. The seats are plush and reasonably comfortable with a soft, supple head rest. I do wish the side adjustment of the head rest held its shape a bit more, it would reset to being flat without much pressure. The padding though was excellent, probably the best I&#x27;ve ever felt sitting in economy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seat doesn&#x27;t recline particularly far, but the bottom cushion slides forward a bit which helps support my longer legs. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;4&amp;quot;, and there&#x27;s about two inches of space between my knees and the seat in front of me. That&#x27;s at least one inch more than American offers on their 787-8, and is on par with ANA and JAL&#x27;s superior leg room on their international 787-9&#x27;s. The tray table is a bit small, but is perfectly capable of supporting a 13&amp;quot; laptop. Power outlets are positioned on the pillars between the seats on the row in front, instead of under the seat cushion (a welcome sight). However, frustratingly there is only one outlet for every two seats. This includes the center four seats, where there is only 2 outlets (one between each pair of aisle and middle seats). Be prepared to share with your neighbor, or have a small power strip with you to let both seats charge simultaneously.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;food&quot;&gt;Food!&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#food&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: food&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economy passengers were offered a choice between a pasta, butter chicken, and ginger pork on this route between Los Angeles (LAX) and Tokyo Haneda (HND). Although the entree and potato salad were delivered as you&#x27;d expect—in the small rectangular container they were heated in, covered in aluminum foil—refreshingly they were served on a plate rather than a large tray. It was a minor difference, but a nice change of pace for sure. Utensils were made from bamboo and were given to us in a napkin free of plastic wrappings, which was also a pleasant surprise. The butter chicken and rice was actually quite good, especially when compared to in-flight meals on other carriers. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway though the flight, they raised the lights to ~50% (very annoying if you&#x27;re a light sleeper) for a drink service and a warm chocolate chip cookie. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secondary meal service consisted of a &amp;quot;Mediterranean Breakfast Calzone, Egg &amp;amp; Cheese&amp;quot; in a box inscribed as such (&amp;quot;whatever the hell that is,&amp;quot; I thought to myself), and a small bowl of fruit. I didn&#x27;t have to wait long to find out that the &amp;quot;calzone&amp;quot; was nothing more than a dense, flavor-less breadstick with a substance that vaguely resembled the look of scrambled egg in the middle. Incredibly disappointing in its own right, it&#x27;s even more egregious given the quality of the meal served at the beginning of the flight.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A personal complaint of mine, when departing at 9am and arriving at 3pm the next day it feels a bit strange to get a lunch service on departure followed by a breakfast service at landing. This complaint isn&#x27;t specific to Delta, it seems to be a common trend across the industry. I&#x27;m sure others probably disagree, it&#x27;s that way for a reason of course. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;delays-delays-delays&quot;&gt;Delays, Delays, Delays&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#delays-delays-delays&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: delays-delays-delays&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, according to the wonderful people over on the  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flyertalk.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;delta-air-lines-skymiles&#x2F;1952193-a330-neo-consolidated-discussion-thread-29.html&quot;&gt;FlyerTalk&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; forum, Delta&#x27;s newest A330-900s appear to be plagued with mechanical faults and delays. My flight was no exception, shortly before even arriving at LAX we were greeted by an unspecified delay of about 75 minutes before we were able to get underway. Based on largely anecdotal evidence, at least some of the faults appear to be due to Airbus&#x27;s attempts to shave weight and make the A330-900 more efficient, at the cost of the durability of the fixtures in the cabin. As one user noted, they were delayed leaving London due to an arm rest that was stuck in the up position (FAA requires them to be in the down position during takeoff and landing). I can&#x27;t speak to this myself as nothing in the cabin on my flight was glaringly broken once I stepped on board, but it&#x27;ll be interesting to see the long-term durability on cabins of the A330. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta appears to be continuing to take deliveries of the A330-900 for revenue service as far as I can tell, so they&#x27;re obviously banking on this aircraft to be a critical part of their long-haul mid-traffic fleet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;connecting-to-the-world&quot;&gt;Connecting to the World&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#connecting-to-the-world&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: connecting-to-the-world&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wi-Fi on this aircraft (at least, directly after departure) was decently quick for satellite-based internet service. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fast.com&quot;&gt;fast.com&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; measured 59Mbps down&#x2F;1.5Mbps up, with an unloaded latency of 582ms and a loaded latency of 1.4s. While this isn&#x27;t incredible by any means, the download speed performed admirably and is more than enough to stream 720p video. While Delta currently offers Wi-Fi service on their domestic flights for free, service on this flight cost $15. The Delta website claims Wi-Fi will be free on all international flights later in 2024, but that remains to be seen. There was also an option for &amp;quot;Free Messaging&amp;quot;, which included service for things like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a delightful surprise, video platforms such as Youtube and voice-chat applications like Discord and Google Meet were not blocked on the network, which is not always the case on other carriers. For instance, on a previous flight I took with American last month, Discord was freely accessible however popular streaming sites like Youtube were blocked (streaming video on American&#x27;s 787-8 was still possible, however speeds in the APAC region were poor. I was able to stream using the video hosting platform NicoChannel on that flight).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a glaring issue with the Wi-Fi service on offer from Delta on the A330-900, at least on this particular route between Los Angeles (LAX) and Tokyo Haneda (HND) here in January 2024. This aircraft&#x27;s internet connectivity is provided by Viasat which, on the surface, would normally be a good thing. Viasat&#x27;s network is far superior in bandwidth to competitors like GoGo—when you&#x27;re inside the coverage area. Due to the failed launch of Viasat&#x27;s Viasat-3 Americas satellite in the second half of 2023, the launch of the Viasat-3 Asia-Pacific satellite was delayed. This results in a coverage map for Delta which includes the United States and southern Canada, a small part of south Alaska, Brazil, the Atlantic, Europe, and the Middle East. Glaringly, on this particular route, Wi-Fi service is only expected to last approximately until passing Seattle, with some additional coverage lasting about 45 minutes to an hour appearing as the plane passes the southern coast of Alaska. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;2024-01-delta-wifi-coverage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Delta&#x27;s Wi-Fi coverage map as of January 2024&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, Delta has pushed forward with retrofitting their older A330-900s, originally equipped with GoGo Inflight, with Viasat&#x27;s hardware. This isn&#x27;t a problem on transcontinental and transatlantic routes, but for routes operating over Asia and the Pacific (including routes to Hawaii), selling Wi-Fi even at $15 feels overpriced for a maximum of 2.5 hours of connectivity on an 11+ hour flight. Now, if Delta&#x27;s claims are true about the service becoming free later in 2024, and if Viasat can get their APAC satellite launched and performing properly, I may consider Delta as my primary carrier when flying across the pacific. For now, considering the fact that I need to work on flights, it&#x27;s not an option. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Liella! was on Weekly 99 Music on FujiTV tonight, including both an interview from one of their costume designers and a performance of their newest single, シェキラ☆☆☆. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;シェキラ☆☆☆ (pronounced &amp;quot;Shekira&amp;quot;, translation: Shake it up!) is the theme song for &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mikansoro.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;liella-99music-shekira&#x2F;#liella-5th-lovelive-twinkle-triangle&quot;&gt;Liella!&#x27;s 5th LoveLive! ~Twinkle Triangle~&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the first leg of which is this weekend in Fukuoka!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you missed it, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tver.jp&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;epaqtkmzxt&quot;&gt;the vod is available for free on TVer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (requires a Japanese IP address, VPN OK). As of writing it doesn&#x27;t require a (free) account to watch, but it may in the future. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;talk-segment&quot;&gt;Talk Segment&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#talk-segment&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: talk-segment&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the performance, Weekly 99 Music interviewed one of Liella!&#x27;s costume design companies as part of their ongoing series of interviews highlighting the behind-the-scenes work in the music industry. オサレカンパニー (Osare Company), the producers of many of Liella!&#x27;s costumes, also produced the costumes for AKB48 and Nogizaka46. One of the designers walked the viewers through the warehouse, which apparently holds more than 40,000 costumes (I believe it, that place was huge!). They also highlighted some of the more creative AKB48 costumes such as the costume for AKB48&#x27;s 37th single, which has a skirt made from pink bubble-wrap.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the works that I&#x27;ve seen from Osare Company, they take an excruciating amount of detail into account when designing costumes. For example, on Nogizaka46&#x27;s outfits all the skirts and dresses are made to fall at an exactly equal height from the floor, regardless of how tall each individual member is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the シェキラ☆☆☆ outfits are filled with small details suited to each member, most of which I had noticed on previous appearances with this outfit back in December. For instance, each member of Liella! has one, two, or three rings on their epaulettes; and one, two, or three stars on the pin on their chest corresponding to which school year their character is currently in in the Love Live! Superstar!! anime. The first-generation members also all wear matching hats, while the second and third generation members have a mixed style of hats and hair ribbons depending on the member. As part of the broadcast, they revealed that the white fabric of the outfit is a different shade for each member generation as well, which is a wonderful yet subtle addition from the designer. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;siekira&quot;&gt;シェキラ☆☆☆&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#siekira&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: siekira&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The song began, and it was clear that every member of Liella! was firing on all cylinders when they made this recording. As the camera panned, each member added their own individual flair to the choreography—distinct from the previous TV appearance of the song. Most apparent of all, Date Sayuri (Liella!&#x27;s center member, affectionately known as Sayurin) was brimming confidence in both her dancing and singing abilities. Every time the camera pointed her way, she&#x27;d fire off a dazzling smile, a cheeky wink, or a heart from her hands. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back during Liella!&#x27;s 4th LoveLive! Tour in August of 2023, Sayurin noted in her final MC that she was finally able to have genuine fun on stage; it was the first time she was able to focus on enjoying every moment on stage instead of worrying about her performance. It showed in her performances back then, and has continued to shine through in her presence on stage ever since. Her movements now are sharp; her singing voice is powerful, packed with love and overflowing with gratitude for everyone who lends her their support. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this doesn&#x27;t look like someone having fun on stage, I couldn&#x27;t possibly guess what that looks like.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;img&#x2F;shekira-sayurin-wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;A GIF of Sayurin, holding her hands in a heart-shape and winking to the camera.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the two TV performances of シェキラ☆☆☆ are anything to go by, we&#x27;re in for an absolutely wonderful treat at Liella!&#x27;s 5th Live. Personally, I can&#x27;t wait, and anyone who&#x27;s on the fence about watching it absolutely should.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

I&#x27;ll be attending all four days, if you&#x27;re there too make sure to say hi!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, hello and welcome! After much pondering and many delays I&#x27;ve finally started to kick off a blog!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-the-blog&quot;&gt;About the blog&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#about-the-blog&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: about-the-blog&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a home for everything that makes my mind tick. I plan to post tutorials, long-form articles, trip reports, travel guides, short tidbits of things I find interesting, and more! I set out building this site with two goals in mind: &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To build somewhere I can be myself, and express any and all my interests in one place&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To express those interests on a platform and in a manner that I control&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platforms like Twitter or Mastodon are great for posting short tidbits and sharing them with others; likewise, blogging platforms like Medium make it easy for anyone to share long-form written content. Most of these platforms excel at a single type of content or topic, but I plan on sharing a wide variety content and formats that don&#x27;t necessarily fit into the structure of a single platform. Also, posting &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; about me and my interests to social platforms feels both (for lack of a better term) &amp;quot;loud&amp;quot; and all but guarantees its sale and aggregation into some large dataset. I&#x27;m not insinuating that content posted to this site &amp;quot;can&#x27;t be scraped&amp;quot; or will never wind up in some massive LLM&#x27;s training data, but at least all the data is still firmly in my control. I built this site with portability in mind, so if the platform hosting this site disappeared tomorrow it could be redeployed elsewhere in a few clicks. No single corporate collapse will keep this page offline forever. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I&#x27;m a verbose person, consider this your warning. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-site-s-technicals&quot;&gt;The site&#x27;s technicals&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-site-s-technicals&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-site-s-technicals&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site was created using &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getzola.org&quot;&gt;Zola&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a static site generation (SSG) tool that ships a as a single binary. It&#x27;s similar to tools like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jekyllrb.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gohugo.io&quot;&gt;Hugo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It boasts full compliance with the CommonMark specification, syntax highlighting for code blocks, easy cross-article and anchor linking, and more. Content (such as this article&#x27;s text!) is written in Markdown, and template files are used to format it into the page you&#x27;re viewing now. Currently I&#x27;m using the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;isunjn&#x2F;serene&#x2F;&quot;&gt;serene&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; theme for Zola, but the design of the site will likely continue to change in the future. Hopefully, only for the better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is currently hosted by Github Pages, as it&#x27;s free and requires minimal ongoing maintenance. I currently use Github as my primary source control server, however I&#x27;ve toyed with the idea of moving personal projects to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sr.ht&quot;&gt;SourceHut&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or a self-hosted &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitea.com&quot;&gt;Gitea&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; instance (which I&#x27;ve done in the past). &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&#x27;t tell you to go out and adopt Zola if you&#x27;re already using another SSG, but it&#x27;s the one I clicked with the most when I was researching options for building this site. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
