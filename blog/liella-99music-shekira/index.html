~Twinkle Triangle~</a>, the first leg of which is this weekend in Fukuoka!<p>If you missed it, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://tver.jp/episodes/epaqtkmzxt>the vod is available for free on TVer</a> (requires a Japanese IP address, VPN OK). As of writing it doesn't require a (free) account to watch, but it may in the future.<h2 id=talk-segment>Talk Segment<a aria-label="Anchor link for: talk-segment" class=zola-anchor href=#talk-segment style=visibility:hidden>#</a></h2><p>Before the performance, Weekly 99 Music interviewed one of Liella!'s costume design companies as part of their ongoing series of interviews highlighting the behind-the-scenes work in the music industry. オサレカンパニー (Osare Company), the producers of many of Liella!'s costumes, also produced the costumes for AKB48 and Nogizaka46. One of the designers walked the viewers through the warehouse, which apparently holds more than 40,000 costumes (I believe it, that place was huge!). They also highlighted some of the more creative AKB48 costumes such as the costume for AKB48's 37th single, which has a skirt made from pink bubble-wrap.<p>From the works that I've seen from Osare Company, they take an excruciating amount of detail into account when designing costumes. For example, on Nogizaka46's outfits all the skirts and dresses are made to fall at an exactly equal height from the floor, regardless of how tall each individual member is.<p>Likewise, the シェキラ☆☆☆ outfits are filled with small details suited to each member, most of which I had noticed on previous appearances with this outfit back in December. For instance, each member of Liella! has one, two, or three rings on their epaulettes; and one, two, or three stars on the pin on their chest corresponding to which school year their character is currently in in the Love Live! Superstar!! anime. The first-generation members also all wear matching hats, while the second and third generation members have a mixed style of hats and hair ribbons depending on the member. As part of the broadcast, they revealed that the white fabric of the outfit is a different shade for each member generation as well, which is a wonderful yet subtle addition from the designer.<h2 id=siekira>シェキラ☆☆☆<a aria-label="Anchor link for: siekira" class=zola-anchor href=#siekira style=visibility:hidden>#</a></h2><p>The song began, and it was clear that every member of Liella! was firing on all cylinders when they made this recording. As the camera panned, each member added their own individual flair to the choreography—distinct from the previous TV appearance of the song. Most apparent of all, Date Sayuri (Liella!'s center member, affectionately known as Sayurin) was brimming confidence in both her dancing and singing abilities. Every time the camera pointed her way, she'd fire off a dazzling smile, a cheeky wink, or a heart from her hands.<p>Back during Liella!'s 4th LoveLive! Tour in August of 2023, Sayurin noted in her final MC that she was finally able to have genuine fun on stage; it was the first time she was able to focus on enjoying every moment on stage instead of worrying about her performance. It showed in her performances back then, and has continued to shine through in her presence on stage ever since. Her movements now are sharp; her singing voice is powerful, packed with love and overflowing with gratitude for everyone who lends her their support.<p>If this doesn't look like someone having fun on stage, I couldn't possibly guess what that looks like.<p><img alt="A GIF of Sayurin, holding her hands in a heart-shape and winking to the camera." src=/img/shekira-sayurin-wink.gif><h2 id=liella-5th-lovelive-twinkle-triangle>Liella! 5th LoveLive! ~Twinkle Triangle~<a aria-label="Anchor link for: liella-5th-lovelive-twinkle-triangle" class=zola-anchor href=#liella-5th-lovelive-twinkle-triangle style=visibility:hidden>#</a></h2><p>If the two TV performances of シェキラ☆☆☆ are anything to go by, we're in for an absolutely wonderful treat at Liella!'s 5th Live. Personally, I can't wait, and anyone who's on the fence about watching it absolutely should.<p>See <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://ramen.events/liella-5th-lovelive>ramen.events</a> for all details, including where to watch the live stream.
